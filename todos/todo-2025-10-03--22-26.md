2. **New Subsection 3 - Context Management and AI Tool Switching**: Added information about:
   - Purpose of context files (switching AI tools, clearing context, sharing status)
   - Naming convention: `icm-context-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`
   - When to generate context files
   - How to generate them with example prompt
   - How to use context files

3. **Updated Subsection 4 - Create Your First Iteration**: Modified workflow to reference the `snb` command as the recommended approach for creating iteration files

4. **Restructured Getting Started Section**: The section now has 5 subsections in logical order:
   - Subsection 1: Install the icmwriper-5 Command
   - Subsection 2: Command Usage (NEW)
   - Subsection 3: Context Management and AI Tool Switching (NEW)
   - Subsection 4: Create Your First Iteration (updated)
   - Subsection 5: Follow the Workflow

### Summary of CLAUDE.md Changes

Enhanced CLAUDE.md with three new sections to provide complete guidance for future Claude Code instances:

1. **CLI Tool Commands Section**: Added comprehensive documentation for all 4 subcommands of the `icmwriper-5` bash script:
   - `generate`: Bootstrap new projects

   - `snb`: Create matched story-bubble pairs (recommended approach)

2. **Updated File Naming Conventions**: Added context file naming pattern:
   - `icm-context-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md` - Context snapshots for AI tool switching/context management

3. **Context Management Section**: Added guidance on when and how to create context files:
   - Use cases: AI tool switching, context clearing, milestone documentation, team sharing
   - Required content: executive summary, requirements, architecture, implementation details, usage examples, status

4. **Important Instruction Reminders**: Added file creation preferences at end of file:
   - Do only what's asked
   - Never create unnecessary files
   - Prefer editing existing files
   - Never proactively create documentation files
