Created: 2025-10-02 00:19

## Comprehensive Technical Specification for README Update

### Overview
Replace the "Getting Started" section 1 (about template files) with installation instructions for the `icmwriper-5` command on Windows 11 WSL2 Ubuntu.

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Changes to README.md

**Location**: Lines 56-63 (the entire subsection "### 1. Set Up Template Files")

**Old Content to Replace**:
```markdown
### 1. Set Up Template Files

The repository includes two template files and one RIPER-5 file:
- `icm-bubble-template.md` - Starting prompt template
- `icm-story-template.md` - Story description template
- `icmwriper-5.md` - Updated RIPER-5 protocol rules
```

**New Content**:
```markdown
### 1. Install the icmwriper-5 Command

#### Prerequisites
- Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04 or later)
- Git installed in WSL2
- curl installed in WSL2

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5.git
   cd ICMwRIPER-5
   ```

2. **Install the command globally**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp icmwriper-5 /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   which icmwriper-5
   ```

   You should see: `/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5`

4. **Test the command**:
   ```bash
   icmwriper-5 generate my-test-project
   ```

   This will create a new directory `my-test-project` with the ICMwRIPER-5 template files.

#### What the Command Does

The `icmwriper-5 generate <project-name>` command:
- Creates a new project directory with the specified name
- Downloads the following template files from this repository:
  - `icm-bubble-template.md` - Starting prompt template
  - `icm-story-template.md` - Story description template
  - `icmwriper-5.md` - RIPER-5 protocol rules
  - `icmwriper-5-README.md` - This README file (renamed from README.md)
```

#### Update Project Structure Section

**Location**: Lines 82-90
