# TODO: Update README.md for Dual-Platform Support

## Implementation Checklist:

1. [ ] Update title and introduction to mention cross-platform support
2. [ ] Add new "Platform Support" section after introduction
3. [ ] Restructure "Getting Started" section with platform-specific installation instructions
4. [ ] Add macOS installation subsection with prerequisites and steps
5. [ ] Update command syntax examples to show both Ubuntu and macOS formats
6. [ ] Update all 4 subcommand examples (generate, story, bubble, snb) with dual-platform examples
7. [ ] Update project structure section to include both script files
8. [ ] Add platform-specific considerations to best practices
9. [ ] Update any remaining Ubuntu-only references to be platform-inclusive
10. [ ] Verify all cross-references and links remain accurate

## Technical Details:

**Approach**: Hybrid structure preserving methodology focus while adding platform-specific technical guidance

**Key Changes**:
- Title: Add cross-platform mention
- New section: Platform Support overview
- Installation: Split into Ubuntu and macOS subsections
- Examples: Show both `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` and `icmwriper-5-for-macos` commands
- Structure: Include both script files

**Platform-Specific Details to Add**:

### Ubuntu Section:
- Prerequisites: Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04+), Git, curl
- Installation: Global install to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Command: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`

### macOS Section:
- Prerequisites: macOS Sequoia 15.6.1+, iTerm2, zsh, Git, curl
- Installation: Local script usage with `./`
- Command: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos`

**Files to Reference**:
- Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`
- macOS: `icmwriper-5-for-macos`
- Both implement identical 4 subcommands: generate, story, bubble, snb

## Platform Comparison for Examples:

### Generate Command:
- Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu generate my-project`
- macOS: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos generate my-project`

### Story Command:
- Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu story icm-story-template.md`
- macOS: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos story icm-story-template.md`

### Bubble Command:
- Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu bubble icm-bubble-template.md`
- macOS: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos bubble icm-bubble-template.md`

### SNB Command:
- Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu snb icm-story-template.md`
- macOS: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos snb icm-story-template.md`

## Implementation Strategy:

1. **Preserve existing structure** where methodology is platform-agnostic
2. **Split technical sections** where platform differences matter
3. **Use clear headers** to distinguish universal vs platform-specific content
4. **Maintain consistency** in naming and formatting across platforms

## Review Section:

### Implementation Summary

Successfully updated README.md to reflect dual-platform support (Ubuntu + macOS) using hybrid structure approach.

### Changes Completed:

1. ✅ **Title and introduction updated**: Added "cross-platform" mention and supported platforms notation

2. ✅ **Platform Support section added**: New section after introduction with:
   - Ubuntu (WSL2) specifications and prerequisites
   - macOS specifications and prerequisites
   - Command syntax differences explained

3. ✅ **Installation section restructured**: Split into platform-specific subsections:
   - Ubuntu installation with global setup
   - macOS installation with local script usage
   - Platform-specific prerequisites clearly listed

4. ✅ **Command examples updated**: All 4 subcommands now show both platforms:
   - generate: Both Ubuntu and macOS syntax
   - story: Both platforms with different timestamp examples
   - bubble: Both platforms with matching examples
   - snb: Both platforms with consistent examples

5. ✅ **Project structure updated**: Added both script files and context files

6. ✅ **Best practices enhanced**: Added platform-specific considerations:
   - Cross-platform testing recommendation
   - Platform-appropriate command usage guidance

7. ✅ **Section numbering corrected**: Fixed section numbering after adding Platform Support section

8. ✅ **Cross-references verified**: All internal references and command syntax consistent

### Key Structural Changes:

**Before**: Ubuntu-only documentation with single platform focus
**After**: Dual-platform documentation with clear platform guidance

**Approach Used**: Hybrid structure that preserves methodology focus while adding platform-specific technical guidance

### Platform Coverage:

- **Ubuntu (WSL2)**: Global installation, `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` command
- **macOS**: Local script, `./icmwriper-5-for-macos` command
- **Both platforms**: Identical functionality with platform-optimized implementations

### User Experience Improvements:

1. **Clear platform selection**: Users can quickly identify their path
2. **Complete installation guidance**: Step-by-step for both platforms
3. **Consistent examples**: All commands shown for both platforms
4. **Best practices**: Platform-specific considerations included

### Update Status: ✅ COMPLETE

README.md now accurately reflects the dual-platform implementation and provides comprehensive guidance for both Ubuntu and macOS users while maintaining the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology focus.
