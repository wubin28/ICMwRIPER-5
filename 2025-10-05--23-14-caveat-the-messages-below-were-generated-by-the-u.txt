✻ Thinking…

  The user has referenced the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol by mentioning 
  @icmwriper-5.md and @icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md. According to the
   protocol I read from the file, I MUST:

  1. Begin EVERY response with mode declaration in brackets
  2. Follow the strict operational protocol
  3. Start in RESEARCH mode unless explicitly told to enter another 
  mode

  The user wants me to convert a Ubuntu script to work on macOS. The 
  business requirements are in the story file that was read 
  automatically. Let me analyze what I have:

  From icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md:
  - The project has implemented 4 subcommands (generate, story, bubble,
   snd) for the @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu command in Windows 11 WSL2 
  Ubuntu 24.04
  - They want me to read @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md and the 
  @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script
  - Copy the script and rename it to icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - Convert it to work on macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 in iTerm2 with zsh
  - Maintain all functionality of the 4 subcommands

  Since no explicit mode transition was given, I should start in 
  RESEARCH mode and focus ONLY on understanding what exists, not 
  suggesting implementations.

  I need to:
  1. Read the context file mentioned
  2. Read the Ubuntu script
  3. Understand the current implementation
  4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

  Let me start with RESEARCH mode.

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the existing Ubuntu script and context
  before proceeding. Let me read the referenced files to understand
   the current implementation.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The context file doesn't exist (there might be a typo in the 
  filename), but I found the Ubuntu script. Let me read it to 
  understand the current implementation.

⏺ Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I now understand the Ubuntu script. Let me also check if there might 
  be a context file with a different filename pattern to get more 
  information.

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icm-context*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Found the context files! The one referenced in the story has a typo 
  (2925 instead of 2025). Let me read the correct context file.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Read 333 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a complete understanding of the current Ubuntu script and 
  its functionality. Let me also examine the template files to 
  understand the full context:

⏺ Search(pattern: "*template*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I've now gathered all the information I need to understand the 
  current Ubuntu script implementation. Let me summarize what I 
  learned:

  Ubuntu Script Analysis (icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu):

  1. Language: Bash shell script with shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
  2. Commands: 4 subcommands - generate, story, bubble, snb
  3. Functionality:
    - generate: Creates new project directory and downloads template 
  files from GitHub
    - story: Copies story file with current timestamp
    - bubble: Copies bubble file with timestamp from latest story file 
   
    - snb: Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical timestamp

  Key Ubuntu-specific dependencies identified:

  - curl for downloading files
  - sed for text replacement (with -i flag for in-place editing)
  - date for timestamp generation 
  - Basic file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls)

  Potential macOS compatibility issues to consider:

  1. sed -i behavior differs between GNU sed (Linux) and BSD sed 
  (macOS)
  2. date command formatting may differ
  3. File system case sensitivity differences
  4. ls sorting behavior
  5. curl availability and options

  Since I'm in RESEARCH mode, I should focus ONLY on understanding and 
  ask clarifying questions if needed.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the Ubuntu script and context files, I
  now understand the current implementation:

  Current Ubuntu Script Analysis

  Script: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu (167 lines)
  Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04Functionality: 4 subcommands
  implemented

  Subcommands:

  1. generate - Creates project directory, downloads 4 template
  files from GitHub
  2. story - Copies story file with current timestamp
  (icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md)
  3. bubble - Copies bubble file using timestamp from latest story
  file, updates story references
  4. snb - Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical
  timestamp

  Key Dependencies Identified:

  - curl for GitHub file downloads
  - sed -i for in-place text replacement
  - date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M" for timestamp generation
  - Standard file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls -t)

  Critical Functions:

  - File existence validation
  - Timestamp extraction from filenames
  - Pattern matching for story reference updates
  - Error handling with cleanup

  Questions for Clarification:

  1. Context file reference: The story mentions
  @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md but the actual file is
  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md (typo in year). Should I proceed
   with the 2025 version?
  2. macOS environment details: You mentioned macOS Sequoia 15.6.1
  with iTerm2 and zsh. Should I assume standard macOS command-line
  tools or do you have any custom installations (like GNU coreutils
   via Homebrew)?
  3. Sudo requirements: The script downloads files and creates
  directories. Are there any specific permissions or locations
  where sudo might be needed that I should be aware of?
  4. GitHub access: The script downloads from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main/.
  Should I assume internet connectivity and GitHub access will work
   the same way on macOS?

  I understand the complete functionality and am ready to proceed
  once you provide any clarifications needed.

  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md (typo in year). Should I proceed
   with the 2025 version?
   A: It's a typo. Please proceed with the 2025 version.
   
  2. macOS environment details: You mentioned macOS Sequoia 15.6.1

  3. Sudo requirements: The script downloads files and creates
  directories. Are there any specific permissions or locations
  where sudo might be needed that I should be aware of?
  A: 我也不知道。请你在执行过程中一旦遇到需要sudo权限的时候就告知我
具体的命令并等待我手工执行完成后再继续。
  
  4. GitHub access: The script downloads from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main/.
  Should I assume internet connectivity and GitHub access will work
   the same way on macOS?
A: 你只须修改当前目录下的脚本`icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`。macOS能够访
问互联网和github。脚本的位置实际上在https://github.com/wubin28/ICMw
RIPER-5。

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. I now have all the information
  needed:

  1. Using the 2025 context file ✓
  2. Standard macOS command-line tools ✓
  3. Will prompt for sudo commands when needed ✓
  4. Internet/GitHub access works on macOS ✓
  5. I only need to modify the local script (not the GitHub
  repository) ✓

  I notice the story file mentions snd as one of the 4 subcommands,
   but analyzing the actual script, it's snb (Story aNd Bubble).
  I'll proceed with the actual implementation which is snb.

  Key Differences Between Ubuntu and macOS

  From my analysis, the main compatibility issues that need
  addressing for macOS are:

  1. sed -i behavior: Ubuntu uses sed -i while macOS requires sed 
  -i '' for in-place editing
  2. date command: Both should work the same with date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  3. File operations: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls should work identically
  4. curl: Should work the same on both platforms
  5. Bash arrays and parameter expansion: Should work identically
  in both environments

  The primary change needed is the sed -i syntax modification for
  macOS compatibility.

  Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode when you give the signal.
