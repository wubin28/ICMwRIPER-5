● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5
  protocol to add new functionality to the Ubuntu
  script. Let me start by researching the current
  implementation and requirements.

  I've read:
  1. The RIPER-5 protocol from icmwriper-5.md
  2. Your requirements from
  icm-story-2025-10-11--09-54.md
  3. Your bubble prompt with context

  Now I need to gather more information to understand
  the current state. Let me read the referenced context
  file and examine the existing script:

● Read(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Read 428 lines

● Search(pattern: "icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu

● Now let me read the current Ubuntu script to
  understand its implementation:

● Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines

● Perfect! I've gathered all the necessary information.
  Let me check if the subdirectory
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard exists in the
  GitHub repository to understand what needs to be
  copied:

● Fetch(https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/tree/main/for
       -py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard)
  ⎿  Received 185.1KB (200 OK)

● Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let
  me summarize what I've learned:

  RESEARCH Summary

  Current Script Status:
  - The icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script is installed at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  - It has 4 existing subcommands: generate, story,
  bubble, snb
  - Total 167 lines of bash code
  - Uses curl to download files from GitHub repository

  New Requirement:
  - Add a new subcommand: generate-html-data-dashboard 
  <project-name>
  - This new command should:
    a. Create project directory <project-name>
    b. Download 4 files from the repository root (same
  as existing generate command)
    c. Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md
    d. Additionally download 2 files from the
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard subdirectory:
        - first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_2
  0250622.xlsx
      - .gitignore

  GitHub Repository Structure Confirmed:
  - Root directory contains: icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md, README.md
  - Subdirectory for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/
  contains: first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset
  _20250622.xlsx, .gitignore

  Key Observations:
  1. The new command is very similar to the existing
  generate command but downloads 2 additional files from
   a subdirectory
  2. All existing functionality must remain intact
  3. The script follows a clear pattern with
  if-elif-else structure for subcommand routing
  4. Error handling includes cleanup on failure and
  proper exit codes

  Questions for clarification:
  None - the requirements are clear and complete.

  Would you like me to move to the next mode (INNOVATE)?

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm potential approaches for adding
  the generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand while
  maintaining all existing functionality.

  Approach Options

  Option 1: Duplicate and Extend the generate Logic

  Concept: Copy the entire generate subcommand logic and
   add the two additional file downloads at the end

  Advantages:
  - Simple and straightforward
  - Minimal risk to existing functionality
  - Easy to understand and maintain
  - Follows the existing pattern of independent
  subcommand blocks

  Disadvantages:
  - Code duplication (the 4 root files download logic is
   repeated)
  - If the root file list changes, need to update in two
   places
  - Slightly longer script

  Option 2: Extract Common Logic into a Function

  Concept: Create a shared function for downloading the
  4 root files, then call it from both generate and
  generate-html-data-dashboard

  Advantages:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  - Single source of truth for root file downloads
  - Cleaner code structure

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires refactoring existing working code
  - Adds complexity with function calls
  - Deviates from the current flat structure where all
  subcommands are self-contained
  - Higher risk of breaking existing generate command

  Option 3: Add Conditional Logic to generate Command

  Concept: Modify the existing generate command to
  accept an optional flag or detect the command name
  variant

  Advantages:
  - Single code path to maintain
  - Most compact implementation

  Disadvantages:
  - Changes existing command behavior
  - More complex conditional logic
  - Higher risk of breaking existing functionality
  - Less clear separation of concerns

  Recommended Approach

  I recommend Option 1: Duplicate and Extend

  Rationale:
  1. Preserves existing functionality: Zero changes to
  the current generate command
  2. Matches existing architecture: The script currently
   uses self-contained if-elif blocks for each
  subcommand
  3. Lower risk: No refactoring of working code
  4. Clear intent: Each subcommand is explicit and
  independent
  5. Easy testing: Can test the new command without
  touching existing commands
  6. Follows project history: The context shows the
  script evolved with independent, self-contained
  subcommands

  Implementation considerations:
  - Add new elif block before the final else statement
  - Copy the generate logic but extend the FILES array
  to include the 2 additional files with subdirectory
  paths
  - Update the GitHub URL construction to handle
  subdirectory paths
  - Maintain identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns
  - Update the usage message to include the new command

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode with this
  approach?

● [MODE: PLAN]

  Detailed Technical Specification

  Objective

  Add a new generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand to
  the icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script that creates a
  project with both root template files and data
  dashboard specific files.

  Files to Modify

  -
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
   (or /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu if working
  with the installed version)

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  Change 1: Update Usage Message (Line 5)

  Location: Line 5

  Current code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | 
  story <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb 
  <story-name>}"

  New code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | 
  generate-html-data-dashboard <project-name> | story 
  <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb 
  <story-name>}"

  Reason: Include the new subcommand in the usage help
  message

  Change 2: Add New Subcommand Handler (After line 162, 
  before the final else)

  Location: Insert between line 162 and line 163

  New code block:
  elif [ "$1" = "generate-html-data-dashboard" ]; then
      # Generate HTML Data Dashboard subcommand handler
      # Store project name
      PROJECT_NAME="$2"

      # Directory existence check
      if [ -d "$PROJECT_NAME" ]; then
          echo "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_NAME' already
   exists."
          exit 1
      fi

      # GitHub repository configuration
      GITHUB_RAW_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
  wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main"

      # Define files to download with their paths
      # Root files (4 files)
      ROOT_FILES=("icm-bubble-template.md"
  "icm-story-template.md" "icmwriper-5.md" "README.md")

      # Subdirectory files (2 files)
      SUBDIR_FILES=("for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboar
  d/first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_2025062
  2.xlsx"
  "for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/.gitignore")

      # Create project directory
      if ! mkdir "$PROJECT_NAME"; then
          echo "Error: Failed to create directory 
  '$PROJECT_NAME'."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Download root files
      for filename in "${ROOT_FILES[@]}"; do
          url="$GITHUB_RAW_URL/$filename"
          if ! curl -f -sS -o "$PROJECT_NAME/$filename"
  "$url"; then
              echo "Error: Failed to download $filename 
  from GitHub. Please check your internet connection and
   repository availability."
              rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME"
              exit 1
          fi
      done

      # Download subdirectory files
      for filepath in "${SUBDIR_FILES[@]}"; do
          # Extract just the filename for the target
          filename=$(basename "$filepath")
          url="$GITHUB_RAW_URL/$filepath"
          if ! curl -f -sS -o "$PROJECT_NAME/$filename"
  "$url"; then
              echo "Error: Failed to download $filepath 
  from GitHub. Please check your internet connection and
   repository availability."
              rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME"
              exit 1
          fi
      done

      # Rename README.md
      mv "$PROJECT_NAME/README.md"
  "$PROJECT_NAME/icmwriper-5-README.md"

      # Success message
      echo "Success: Project '$PROJECT_NAME' created 
  with ICMwRIPER-5 template files and HTML data 
  dashboard resources."
      exit 0

  Reason: Implements the new subcommand with the same
  error handling patterns as existing commands

  Change 3: Update Error Message for Unknown Commands 
  (Line 164)

  Location: Line 164

  Current code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands:
   'generate', 'story', 'bubble', 'snb'."

  New code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands:
   'generate', 'generate-html-data-dashboard', 'story', 
  'bubble', 'snb'."

  Reason: Include the new command in the error message

  Implementation Notes

  1. File download strategy: Download root files first
  (4 files), then subdirectory files (2 files)
  2. Target location: All 6 files go into the project
  root directory (flatten the structure)
  3. Error handling: If any download fails, remove the
  entire project directory and exit
  4. URL construction: Use basename to extract filename
  from subdirectory path for the target filename
  5. Cleanup pattern: Identical to existing generate
  command - rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME" on any failure
  6. Exit codes: Exit 0 on success, exit 1 on any error

  Testing Requirements

  After implementation, verify:
  1. ✓ Existing generate command still works correctly
  2. ✓ Existing story, bubble, snb commands still work
  correctly
  3. ✓ New generate-html-data-dashboard command creates
  directory
  4. ✓ All 6 files are downloaded correctly
  5. ✓ README.md is renamed to icmwriper-5-README.md
  6. ✓ Error handling works (directory exists, download
  fails, etc.)
  7. ✓ Usage message displays correctly when no
  arguments provided

  ---
  IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

  1. Read the current script file at
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  2. Update the usage message on line 5 to include the
  new generate-html-data-dashboard command
  3. Add the new generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand
   handler between line 162 and line 163
  4. Update the error message on line 164 to include the
   new command name
  5. Test the script by running it without arguments to
  verify usage message
  6. Test the new generate-html-data-dashboard command
  with a test project name
  7. Verify all 6 files are downloaded correctly
  8. Verify README.md is renamed correctly
  9. Test existing generate command to ensure it still
  works
  10. Test error handling (try creating a project that
  already exists)

  Now I'll create the todo file with this plan:

     # Implementation Plan: Add
     generate-html-data-dashboard Subcommand
     **Created**: 2025-10-11 12:14
     **Status**: Pending approval
     ## Objective
     Add a new `generate-html-data-dashboard` subcommand
      to the `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` script that
     creates a project with both root template files and
      data dashboard specific files.
     ## Files to Modify
     - `/home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-
     ubuntu`
     … +135 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Plan Complete

  I've created a comprehensive implementation plan in
  todo-2025-10-11--12-14.md with:

  ✅ 3 specific code changes with exact line numbers and
   before/after code
  ✅ 10-step implementation checklist for systematic
  execution
  ✅ Detailed implementation notes covering file
  download strategy, error handling, and cleanup
  ✅ Testing requirements to verify both new and
  existing functionality

  Summary of Changes:

  1. Line 5: Update usage message to include new command
  2. After line 162: Add new
  generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand (58 lines of
  code)
  3. Line 164: Update error message to include new
  command

  Key Design Decisions:

  - Downloads 6 total files: 4 from root + 2 from
  subdirectory
  - All files are placed in project root (flattened
  structure)
  - Uses basename to extract filenames from subdirectory
   paths
  - Maintains identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns as existing generate command
  - Zero modifications to existing commands

  The plan is ready for your approval. Would you like me
   to proceed to EXECUTE mode?
