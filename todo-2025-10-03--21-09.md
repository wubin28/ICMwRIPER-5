## Technical Specification for `snb` Subcommand Implementation

### 1. File to Modify
- **File**: `/home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5`
- **Current lines**: 119
- **Modification type**: Add new subcommand handler

### 2. Changes Required

#### Change 1: Update Usage Message
**Location**: Line 5

**Current code**:
```bash
echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | story <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name>}"
```

**New code**:
```bash
echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | story <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb <story-name>}"
```

#### Change 2: Add `snb` Subcommand Handler
**Location**: After line 114 (after the `bubble` command handler's closing), before line 115 (before the `else` clause)

**Insert new code block**:
```bash
elif [ "$1" = "snb" ]; then
    # SNB (Story aNd Bubble) subcommand handler
    # Store story name
    STORY_NAME="$2"

    # Check if source story file exists
    if [ ! -f "$STORY_NAME" ]; then
        echo "Error: File '$STORY_NAME' does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check if bubble template exists
    if [ ! -f "icm-bubble-template.md" ]; then
        echo "Error: File 'icm-bubble-template.md' does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Generate timestamp (will be used for both files)
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")

    # Define target filenames
    STORY_TARGET="icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    BUBBLE_TARGET="icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md"

    # Copy story file
    if ! cp "$STORY_NAME" "$STORY_TARGET"; then
        echo "Error: Failed to copy '$STORY_NAME' to '$STORY_TARGET'."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Copy bubble file
    if ! cp "icm-bubble-template.md" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"; then
        echo "Error: Failed to copy 'icm-bubble-template.md' to '$BUBBLE_TARGET'."
        # Cleanup: remove the story file that was already created
        rm -f "$STORY_TARGET"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Replace the story reference with the newly created story filename
    sed -i "s/@icm-story-[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

    # Success message
    echo "Success: Copied '$STORY_NAME' to '$STORY_TARGET'."
    echo "Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to '$BUBBLE_TARGET' and updated story reference to '$STORY_TARGET'."
    exit 0
```

#### Change 3: Update Error Message for Unknown Commands
**Location**: Line 116

**Current code**:
```bash
echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands: 'generate', 'story', 'bubble'."
```

**New code**:
```bash
echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands: 'generate', 'story', 'bubble', 'snb'."
```

### 3. Implementation Logic Flow

**SNB command execution flow**:
1. Validate that `<story-name>` file exists
2. Validate that `icm-bubble-template.md` exists
3. Generate single timestamp using `date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"`
4. Define both target filenames using the same timestamp
5. Copy story file to `icm-story-<timestamp>.md`
6. Copy bubble template to `icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md`
   - If this fails, cleanup the story file and exit
7. Update story references in the bubble file using `sed`
8. Output two success messages (one for story, one for bubble)

### 4. Error Handling

**Error cases**:
1. Source story file doesn't exist → Exit with error message
2. Bubble template doesn't exist → Exit with error message
3. Story copy fails → Exit with error message
4. Bubble copy fails → Remove story file (cleanup), then exit with error message

**Cleanup strategy**: If bubble file creation fails after story file is created, remove the story file to maintain consistency.

### 5. Testing Scenarios

**Test 1: Normal operation**
- Command: `icmwriper-5 snb icm-story-template.md`
- Expected: Creates both files with same timestamp, updates reference

**Test 2: Story file doesn't exist**
- Command: `icmwriper-5 snb nonexistent.md`
- Expected: Error message, no files created

**Test 3: Bubble template doesn't exist**
- Command: `icmwriper-5 snb icm-story-template.md` (after removing template)
- Expected: Error message, no files created

**Test 4: Verify existing commands still work**
- `icmwriper-5 story icm-story-template.md` → Should work
- `icmwriper-5 bubble icm-bubble-template.md` → Should work
- `icmwriper-5 generate test-project` → Should work

### 6. Final Script Structure

After implementation, the script will have:
- Lines 1-114: Existing code (with updated usage message)
- Lines 115-160 (approx): New `snb` subcommand handler
- Lines 161-164 (approx): Else clause for unknown commands (with updated message)
