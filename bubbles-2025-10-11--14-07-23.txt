● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5
  protocol to add new functionality to the Ubuntu
  script. Let me start by researching the current
  implementation and requirements.

  I've read:
  1. The RIPER-5 protocol from icmwriper-5.md
  2. Your requirements from
  icm-story-2025-10-11--09-54.md
  3. Your bubble prompt with context

  Now I need to gather more information to understand
  the current state. Let me read the referenced context
  file and examine the existing script:

● Read(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Read 428 lines

● Search(pattern: "icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu

● Now let me read the current Ubuntu script to
  understand its implementation:

● Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines

● Perfect! I've gathered all the necessary information.
  Let me check if the subdirectory
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard exists in the
  GitHub repository to understand what needs to be
  copied:

● Fetch(https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/tree/main/for
       -py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard)
  ⎿  Received 185.1KB (200 OK)

● Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let
  me summarize what I've learned:

  RESEARCH Summary

  Current Script Status:
  - The icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script is installed at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  - It has 4 existing subcommands: generate, story,
  bubble, snb
  - Total 167 lines of bash code
  - Uses curl to download files from GitHub repository

  New Requirement:
  - Add a new subcommand: generate-html-data-dashboard 
  <project-name>
  - This new command should:
    a. Create project directory <project-name>
    b. Download 4 files from the repository root (same
  as existing generate command)
    c. Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md
    d. Additionally download 2 files from the
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard subdirectory:
        - first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_2
  0250622.xlsx
      - .gitignore

  GitHub Repository Structure Confirmed:
  - Root directory contains: icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md, README.md
  - Subdirectory for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/
  contains: first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset
  _20250622.xlsx, .gitignore

  Key Observations:
  1. The new command is very similar to the existing
  generate command but downloads 2 additional files from
   a subdirectory
  2. All existing functionality must remain intact
  3. The script follows a clear pattern with
  if-elif-else structure for subcommand routing
  4. Error handling includes cleanup on failure and
  proper exit codes

  Questions for clarification:
  None - the requirements are clear and complete.

  Would you like me to move to the next mode (INNOVATE)?

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm potential approaches for adding
  the generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand while
  maintaining all existing functionality.

  Approach Options

  Option 1: Duplicate and Extend the generate Logic

  Concept: Copy the entire generate subcommand logic and
   add the two additional file downloads at the end

  Advantages:
  - Simple and straightforward
  - Minimal risk to existing functionality
  - Easy to understand and maintain
  - Follows the existing pattern of independent
  subcommand blocks

  Disadvantages:
  - Code duplication (the 4 root files download logic is
   repeated)
  - If the root file list changes, need to update in two
   places
  - Slightly longer script

  Option 2: Extract Common Logic into a Function

  Concept: Create a shared function for downloading the
  4 root files, then call it from both generate and
  generate-html-data-dashboard

  Advantages:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  - Single source of truth for root file downloads
  - Cleaner code structure

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires refactoring existing working code
  - Adds complexity with function calls
  - Deviates from the current flat structure where all
  subcommands are self-contained
  - Higher risk of breaking existing generate command

  Option 3: Add Conditional Logic to generate Command

  Concept: Modify the existing generate command to
  accept an optional flag or detect the command name
  variant

  Advantages:
  - Single code path to maintain
  - Most compact implementation

  Disadvantages:
  - Changes existing command behavior
  - More complex conditional logic
  - Higher risk of breaking existing functionality
  - Less clear separation of concerns

  Recommended Approach

  I recommend Option 1: Duplicate and Extend

  Rationale:
  1. Preserves existing functionality: Zero changes to
  the current generate command
  2. Matches existing architecture: The script currently
   uses self-contained if-elif blocks for each
  subcommand
  3. Lower risk: No refactoring of working code
  4. Clear intent: Each subcommand is explicit and
  independent
  5. Easy testing: Can test the new command without
  touching existing commands
  6. Follows project history: The context shows the
  script evolved with independent, self-contained
  subcommands

  Implementation considerations:
  - Add new elif block before the final else statement
  - Copy the generate logic but extend the FILES array
  to include the 2 additional files with subdirectory
  paths
  - Update the GitHub URL construction to handle
  subdirectory paths
  - Maintain identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns
  - Update the usage message to include the new command

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode with this
  approach?

● [MODE: PLAN]

  Detailed Technical Specification

  Objective

  Add a new generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand to
  the icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script that creates a
  project with both root template files and data
  dashboard specific files.

  Files to Modify

  -
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
   (or /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu if working
  with the installed version)

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  Change 1: Update Usage Message (Line 5)

  Location: Line 5

  Current code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | 
  story <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb 
  <story-name>}"

  New code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | 
  generate-html-data-dashboard <project-name> | story 
  <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb 
  <story-name>}"

  Reason: Include the new subcommand in the usage help
  message

  Change 2: Add New Subcommand Handler (After line 162, 
  before the final else)

  Location: Insert between line 162 and line 163

  New code block:
  elif [ "$1" = "generate-html-data-dashboard" ]; then
      # Generate HTML Data Dashboard subcommand handler
      # Store project name
      PROJECT_NAME="$2"

      # Directory existence check
      if [ -d "$PROJECT_NAME" ]; then
          echo "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_NAME' already
   exists."
          exit 1
      fi

      # GitHub repository configuration
      GITHUB_RAW_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
  wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main"

      # Define files to download with their paths
      # Root files (4 files)
      ROOT_FILES=("icm-bubble-template.md"
  "icm-story-template.md" "icmwriper-5.md" "README.md")

      # Subdirectory files (2 files)
      SUBDIR_FILES=("for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboar
  d/first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_2025062
  2.xlsx"
  "for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/.gitignore")

      # Create project directory
      if ! mkdir "$PROJECT_NAME"; then
          echo "Error: Failed to create directory 
  '$PROJECT_NAME'."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Download root files
      for filename in "${ROOT_FILES[@]}"; do
          url="$GITHUB_RAW_URL/$filename"
          if ! curl -f -sS -o "$PROJECT_NAME/$filename"
  "$url"; then
              echo "Error: Failed to download $filename 
  from GitHub. Please check your internet connection and
   repository availability."
              rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME"
              exit 1
          fi
      done

      # Download subdirectory files
      for filepath in "${SUBDIR_FILES[@]}"; do
          # Extract just the filename for the target
          filename=$(basename "$filepath")
          url="$GITHUB_RAW_URL/$filepath"
          if ! curl -f -sS -o "$PROJECT_NAME/$filename"
  "$url"; then
              echo "Error: Failed to download $filepath 
  from GitHub. Please check your internet connection and
   repository availability."
              rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME"
              exit 1
          fi
      done

      # Rename README.md
      mv "$PROJECT_NAME/README.md"
  "$PROJECT_NAME/icmwriper-5-README.md"

      # Success message
      echo "Success: Project '$PROJECT_NAME' created 
  with ICMwRIPER-5 template files and HTML data 
  dashboard resources."
      exit 0

  Reason: Implements the new subcommand with the same
  error handling patterns as existing commands

  Change 3: Update Error Message for Unknown Commands 
  (Line 164)

  Location: Line 164

  Current code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands:
   'generate', 'story', 'bubble', 'snb'."

  New code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands:
   'generate', 'generate-html-data-dashboard', 'story', 
  'bubble', 'snb'."

  Reason: Include the new command in the error message

  Implementation Notes

  1. File download strategy: Download root files first
  (4 files), then subdirectory files (2 files)
  2. Target location: All 6 files go into the project
  root directory (flatten the structure)
  3. Error handling: If any download fails, remove the
  entire project directory and exit
  4. URL construction: Use basename to extract filename
  from subdirectory path for the target filename
  5. Cleanup pattern: Identical to existing generate
  command - rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME" on any failure
  6. Exit codes: Exit 0 on success, exit 1 on any error

  Testing Requirements

  After implementation, verify:
  1. ✓ Existing generate command still works correctly
  2. ✓ Existing story, bubble, snb commands still work
  correctly
  3. ✓ New generate-html-data-dashboard command creates
  directory
  4. ✓ All 6 files are downloaded correctly
  5. ✓ README.md is renamed to icmwriper-5-README.md
  6. ✓ Error handling works (directory exists, download
  fails, etc.)
  7. ✓ Usage message displays correctly when no
  arguments provided

  ---
  IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

  1. Read the current script file at
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  2. Update the usage message on line 5 to include the
  new generate-html-data-dashboard command
  3. Add the new generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand
   handler between line 162 and line 163
  4. Update the error message on line 164 to include the
   new command name
  5. Test the script by running it without arguments to
  verify usage message
  6. Test the new generate-html-data-dashboard command
  with a test project name
  7. Verify all 6 files are downloaded correctly
  8. Verify README.md is renamed correctly
  9. Test existing generate command to ensure it still
  works
  10. Test error handling (try creating a project that
  already exists)

  Now I'll create the todo file with this plan:

     # Implementation Plan: Add
     generate-html-data-dashboard Subcommand
     **Created**: 2025-10-11 12:14
     **Status**: Pending approval
     ## Objective
     Add a new `generate-html-data-dashboard` subcommand
      to the `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` script that
     creates a project with both root template files and
      data dashboard specific files.
     ## Files to Modify
     - `/home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-
     ubuntu`
     … +135 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Plan Complete

  I've created a comprehensive implementation plan in
  todo-2025-10-11--12-14.md with:

  ✅ 3 specific code changes with exact line numbers and
   before/after code
  ✅ 10-step implementation checklist for systematic
  execution
  ✅ Detailed implementation notes covering file
  download strategy, error handling, and cleanup
  ✅ Testing requirements to verify both new and
  existing functionality

  Summary of Changes:

  1. Line 5: Update usage message to include new command
  2. After line 162: Add new
  generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand (58 lines of
  code)
  3. Line 164: Update error message to include new
  command

  Key Design Decisions:

  - Downloads 6 total files: 4 from root + 2 from
  subdirectory
  - All files are placed in project root (flattened
  structure)
  - Uses basename to extract filenames from subdirectory
   paths
  - Maintains identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns as existing generate command
  - Zero modifications to existing commands

  The plan is ready for your approval. Would you like me
   to proceed to EXECUTE mode?

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5
  protocol to update the context file. Let me research
  the current situation by reading the necessary files.

  I need to read:
  1. The previous story file:
  icm-story-2025-10-11--09-54.md (already read earlier)
  2. The previous bubble file:
  icm-bubble-2025-10-11--09-54.md (already read earlier)
  3. The old context file:
  icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md (already read
  earlier)
  4. The new story file: icm-story-2025-10-11--13-37.md
  (already read above)

  Let me read the bubble file that corresponds to the
  new story:

● Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-11--13-37.md)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines

● Good. Now let me review the todo file from the recent
  implementation to understand what was accomplished:

● Read(todo-2025-10-11--12-14.md)
  ⎿  Read 70 lines

● Perfect. Now let me check the current script to verify
   its final state:

● Bash(wc -l /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for
      -ubuntu)
  ⎿ 222 /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for
    -ubuntu


● RESEARCH Summary

  I have gathered all necessary information to
  understand the task:

  Task Understanding:
  - Copy the old context file
  icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md
  - Rename the copy with current timestamp
  - Update the context file to reflect the latest
  changes from the recent implementation

  Previous Context File 
  (icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md):
  - Documents the ICMwRIPER-5 CLI tool as of 2025-10-05
  - Describes 4 subcommands: generate, story, bubble,
  snb
  - Script was 167 lines
  - Status: Both Ubuntu and macOS implementations
  completed

  Latest Changes (from icm-story-2025-10-11--09-54.md 
  and implementation):
  - New Requirement: Add generate-html-data-dashboard
  subcommand for Ubuntu script
  - Implementation Completed: 2025-10-11 12:27
  - Changes Made:
    a. Added new subcommand generate-html-data-dashboard
   (lines 164-218)
    b. Downloads 6 files total: 4 root files + 2 data
  dashboard files
    c. Updated usage message and error messages
    d. Script grew from 167 to 223 lines (actually 222
  lines per wc count)
  - All existing functionality preserved

  Key Technical Details:
  - New subcommand downloads from subdirectory
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/
  - Files: first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_
  20250622.xlsx and .gitignore
  - All files placed in project root (flattened
  structure)
  - Uses basename to extract filenames from subdirectory
   paths

  Questions: None - all information is clear.

  Would you like me to proceed to INNOVATE mode?

> ENTER INNOVATE MODE 

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm potential approaches for updating
  the context file to reflect the latest changes.

  Approach Options

  Option 1: Comprehensive Rewrite

  Concept: Create an entirely new context file from
  scratch, incorporating all information from the old
  context plus the new changes

  Advantages:
  - Ensures complete accuracy and consistency
  - Opportunity to reorganize and improve structure
  - No risk of missing updates

  Disadvantages:
  - Time-consuming
  - May unnecessarily change sections that didn't need
  updates
  - Could introduce unintended modifications to stable
  sections

  Option 2: Surgical Update

  Concept: Copy the old context file and make targeted
  updates only to sections that changed

  Advantages:
  - Preserves well-written existing content
  - Faster and more efficient
  - Clear what changed between versions
  - Minimizes risk of introducing errors in unchanged
  sections

  Disadvantages:
  - Need to identify all sections requiring updates
  - Could miss subtle implications of changes

  Option 3: Append-Only Update

  Concept: Copy the old context and add a new "Latest
  Development" section at the end describing the new
  changes

  Advantages:
  - Preserves historical record
  - Very quick to implement
  - Clear chronological progression

  Disadvantages:
  - Context file becomes increasingly long over time
  - Information about the same feature may be scattered
  - Less organized and harder to read

  Recommended Approach

  I recommend Option 2: Surgical Update

  Rationale:
  1. Efficiency: The old context is well-structured and
  most sections remain accurate
  2. Clarity: Focused updates make it clear what changed
  3. Maintainability: Preserves the existing
  organization that works well
  4. Accuracy: Minimizes risk of introducing errors in
  stable sections

  Sections Requiring Updates:

  1. Executive Summary: Update script capabilities to
  mention 5 subcommands (not 4)
  2. Business Requirements: Add new section for HTML
  Data Dashboard generation
  3. Script Architecture: Update subcommand count from 4
   to 5
  4. Implementation Details: Add description of new
  generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand
  5. Usage Examples: Add example showing the new command
  6. Latest Development: Replace the 2025-10-05 macOS
  conversion section with 2025-10-11 Ubuntu enhancement
  7. Context Metadata: Update timestamps, iteration
  count, script size, and current story-bubble pair

  Sections NOT Requiring Updates:
  - Technical Architecture (technology stack unchanged)
  - File Naming Conventions (unchanged)
  - Existing subcommand descriptions (generate, story,
  bubble, snb)
  - Most design decisions (still applicable)

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode with this
  approach?

● [MODE: PLAN]

  Detailed Technical Specification for Context File 
  Update

  Objective

  Create an updated context file that reflects the
  addition of the generate-html-data-dashboard
  subcommand to the Ubuntu script, while preserving all
  existing accurate information.

  Files to Create/Modify

  - Create: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icm-context-
  2025-10-11--13-59.md (new timestamped context file)
  - Source: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icm-context-
  2025-10-05--23-56.md (old context to copy)

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  Step 1: Copy and Rename Context File

  Action: Copy the old context file with current
  timestamp

  Command:
  cp icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md
  icm-context-2025-10-11--13-59.md

  Step 2: Update Executive Summary Section (Lines 3-25)

  Location: Lines 7-8 in "Current Status" subsection

  Old text:
  **Current Status**: Dual platform implementation
  completed - Ubuntu and macOS versions fully functional

  New text:
  **Current Status**: Dual platform implementation
  completed - Ubuntu enhanced with HTML data dashboard
  support, macOS version fully functional

  Location: Lines 19-24 in "Quick Capabilities"
  subsection

  Old text:
  **Quick Capabilities**:
  - Generate new projects with template files from
  GitHub
  - Create timestamped story files
  - Create timestamped bubble files with automatic story
   reference updates
  - Create matched story-bubble file pairs in a single
  command
  - **NEW**: Full cross-platform compatibility between
  Ubuntu and macOS

  New text:
  **Quick Capabilities**:
  - Generate new projects with template files from
  GitHub
  - Generate HTML data dashboard projects with
  additional data files
  - Create timestamped story files
  - Create timestamped bubble files with automatic story
   reference updates
  - Create matched story-bubble file pairs in a single
  command
  - Full cross-platform compatibility between Ubuntu and
   macOS

  Step 3: Add New Business Requirement Section (After 
  line 62)

  Location: After the "Combined Story-Bubble Creation"
  section (around line 62)

  Insert new section:
  ### HTML Data Dashboard Project Generation

  **Requirement**: Users need to quickly bootstrap new
  data dashboard projects with both ICMwRIPER-5
  templates and data files

  **Solution**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  generate-html-data-dashboard <project-name>` command

  **What it provides**: Downloads 6 files from GitHub
  repository:
  - 4 standard template files (same as `generate`
  command)
  - 2 additional data dashboard files from subdirectory

  **Files downloaded**:
  - `icm-bubble-template.md`
  - `icm-story-template.md`
  - `icmwriper-5.md`
  - `README.md` (renamed to `icmwriper-5-README.md`)
  - `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_202506
  22.xlsx`
  - `.gitignore`

  **Key behavior**: All files placed in project root
  directory (flattened structure)

  **Use case**: Specialized for
  Python/HTML/CSS/JavaScript data visualization projects

  Step 4: Update Script Architecture Section (Line 113)

  Location: Line 113 in "Supported subcommands"
  subsection

  Old text:
  **Supported subcommands**: `generate`, `story`,
  `bubble`, `snb`

  New text:
  **Supported subcommands**: `generate`,
  `generate-html-data-dashboard`, `story`, `bubble`,
  `snb`

  Step 5: Add Implementation Details for New Subcommand 
  (After line 196)

  Location: After "Script Architecture" section, before
  "Implementation Details" section heading (around line
  196)

  Insert before "## Implementation Details" heading:
  ### Key Design Decisions (Continued)

  #### Decision 8: HTML Data Dashboard as separate
  command

  **Rationale**: Keep `generate` simple for general use
  while providing specialized command for data projects

  **Implementation**: New `generate-html-data-dashboard`
   subcommand with extended file list

  **File strategy**:
  - Downloads 4 root files using ROOT_FILES array
  - Downloads 2 subdirectory files using SUBDIR_FILES
  array with full paths
  - Uses `basename` to extract filenames for target
  location

  **Benefits**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Users can choose appropriate command for their
  project type
  - No breaking changes to existing `generate` command

  Step 6: Update Implementation Details Section (After 
  line 201)

  Location: After line 201 in the "Implementation
  Details" section intro

  Old text:
  **Ubuntu script**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` (167
  lines)

  New text:
  **Ubuntu script**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` (223
  lines)

  Step 7: Add New Subcommand Documentation (After line 
  301)

  Location: After the "snb Subcommand" section (around
  line 301), before "## Usage Examples"

  Insert new section:
  ### generate-html-data-dashboard Subcommand

  **Functionality**:
  - Creates new project directory
  - Downloads 6 template and data files from GitHub
  - Renames `README.md` to `icmwriper-5-README.md`

  **Implementation approach**:
  1. Validate that project directory doesn't already
  exist
  2. Create directory with `mkdir`
  3. Loop through ROOT_FILES array (4 files), 
  downloading each with `curl -f -sS -o`
  4. Loop through SUBDIR_FILES array (2 files with
  subdirectory paths):
     - Extract filename using `basename`
     - Download from subdirectory path
     - Save to project root with extracted filename
  5. If any download fails, remove entire directory and
  exit
  6. Rename README file with `mv`
  7. Output success message

  **Key validation**:
  - Directory existence check before creation
  - Curl failure detection with cleanup
  - Exactly 2 arguments required

  **Key technical details**:
  - ROOT_FILES: `("icm-bubble-template.md" 
  "icm-story-template.md" "icmwriper-5.md" "README.md")`
  - SUBDIR_FILES:
  `("for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/first-80-rows-
  agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx"
  "for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/.gitignore")`
  - Uses `basename` to flatten directory structure
  - All 6 files end up in project root directory

  Step 8: Add Usage Example (After line 318)

  Location: After "Example 1: Creating a new project"
  (around line 318), before "Example 2"

  Insert new example:
  ### Example 1b: Creating a data dashboard project

  **Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  $ icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu generate-html-data-dashboard
  my-dashboard-kata
  Success: Project 'my-dashboard-kata' created with
  ICMwRIPER-5 template files and HTML data dashboard
  resources.

  Result: Creates directory with 6 files (4 templates +
  2 data files)

  macOS: Command not yet available (Ubuntu only)

  #### Step 9: Update Context for AI Tools Section (Line
   371)
  **Location**: Line 371 - update the opening paragraph

  **Old text**:
  This context was updated after completing the macOS
  conversion project (2025-10-05). Both Ubuntu and macOS
   scripts are fully functional and tested. When
  continuing development:

  **New text**:
  This context was updated after adding the
  generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand (2025-10-11).
  Both Ubuntu and macOS scripts are fully functional and
   tested, with Ubuntu now supporting data dashboard
  project generation. When continuing development:

  #### Step 10: Update Latest Development Section (Lines
   391-405)
  **Location**: Replace entire "## Latest Development
  (2025-10-05)" section

  **Old section** (lines 391-405):
  ```markdown
  ## Latest Development (2025-10-05)

  **Requirement**: Convert Ubuntu script to macOS
  compatibility while preserving all functionality

  **Implementation completed**:
  - Created `icmwriper-5-for-macos` from
  `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`
  - Updated usage message to reference correct script
  name
  - Modified sed commands for macOS compatibility:
    - Added `-E` flag for extended regex support
    - Changed quantifier syntax from `\{n\}` to `{n}`
    - Maintained `-i ''` for in-place editing
  - All 4 subcommands tested and verified functional on
  macOS Sequoia 15.6.1
  - Story reference replacement confirmed working in
  bubble files

  **Key technical challenge resolved**: macOS sed
  doesn't support basic regex quantifiers `\{n\}` by
  default, requiring extended regex mode and syntax
  updates.

  New section:
  ## Latest Development (2025-10-11)

  **Requirement**: Add `generate-html-data-dashboard`
  subcommand to Ubuntu script for specialized data
  visualization projects

  **Implementation completed**:
  - Added new subcommand `generate-html-data-dashboard`
  (lines 164-218, 55 lines)
  - Updated usage message to include new command
  - Updated error messages for unknown commands
  - Downloads 6 files total: 4 root templates + 2 data
  dashboard files
  - Data files downloaded from subdirectory:
  `for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/`
  - Files: `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset
  _20250622.xlsx` and `.gitignore`
  - All files placed in project root (flattened
  structure using `basename`)
  - All existing commands remain unchanged and fully
  functional
  - Comprehensive testing completed successfully

  **Key technical implementation**:
  - Used separate arrays for root files (ROOT_FILES) and
   subdirectory files (SUBDIR_FILES)
  - Applied `basename` function to extract filenames
  from subdirectory paths
  - Maintained identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns as existing `generate` command

  **Script growth**: 167 lines → 223 lines (+56 lines)

  Step 11: Update Context Metadata Section (Lines 
  407-428)

  Location: Lines 410-428
