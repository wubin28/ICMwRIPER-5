● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the current implementation of the
  icmwriper-5 command before proceeding. Let me examine the
  codebase structure and locate the command implementation.

● RESEARCH OBSERVATIONS:

  The current icmwriper-5 command is a bash script located at
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 with the
  following characteristics:

  1. Current functionality: Only supports icmwriper-5 generate 
  <project-name> subcommand
  2. Current structure:
    - Validates exactly 2 arguments
    - Only accepts "generate" as the first subcommand
    - Downloads template files from GitHub
    - Creates a new project directory

  REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS:

  According to icm-story-2025-10-02--09-50.md, the new
  requirement is:
  - Add a story subcommand: icmwriper-5 story <story-name>
  - Copy file <story-name> from current directory
  - Name the copy as icm-story-<timestamp> where timestamp is
  current system time

  QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION:

  1. What timestamp format should be used? (e.g.,
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm based on existing file naming patterns in
  the repository?)
  2. Should the command validate that <story-name> file exists
  before copying?
  3. Should there be error handling if the copy operation
  fails?
  4. Should the new icm-story-<timestamp> file be created in
  the current directory or in a specific location?

  1. What timestamp format should be used? (e.g.,
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm based on existing file naming patterns in
  the repository?)
A: Based on existing file naming patterns in the repository, such as `2025-10-02--20-19`.

  2. Should the command validate that <story-name> file exists
  before copying?
A: Yes. And report the issue and quit if find any errors.

  3. Should there be error handling if the copy operation
  fails?
A: Yes. And report the issue and quit if find any errors.

  4. Should the new icm-story-<timestamp> file be created in
  the current directory or in a specific location?
A: Created in the current directory, please.
