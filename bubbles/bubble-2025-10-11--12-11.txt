● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5
  protocol to add new functionality to the Ubuntu
  script. Let me start by researching the current
  implementation and requirements.

  I've read:
  1. The RIPER-5 protocol from icmwriper-5.md
  2. Your requirements from
  icm-story-2025-10-11--09-54.md
  3. Your bubble prompt with context

  Now I need to gather more information to understand
  the current state. Let me read the referenced context
  file and examine the existing script:

● Read(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Read 428 lines

● Search(pattern: "icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu

● Now let me read the current Ubuntu script to
  understand its implementation:

● Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines

● Perfect! I've gathered all the necessary information.
  Let me check if the subdirectory
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard exists in the
  GitHub repository to understand what needs to be
  copied:

● Fetch(https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/tree/main/for
       -py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard)
  ⎿  Received 185.1KB (200 OK)

● Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let
  me summarize what I've learned:

  RESEARCH Summary

  Current Script Status:
  - The icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script is installed at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu
  - It has 4 existing subcommands: generate, story,
  bubble, snb
  - Total 167 lines of bash code
  - Uses curl to download files from GitHub repository

  New Requirement:
  - Add a new subcommand: generate-html-data-dashboard 
  <project-name>
  - This new command should:
    a. Create project directory <project-name>
    b. Download 4 files from the repository root (same
  as existing generate command)
    c. Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md
    d. Additionally download 2 files from the
  for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard subdirectory:
        - first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_2
  0250622.xlsx
      - .gitignore

  GitHub Repository Structure Confirmed:
  - Root directory contains: icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md, README.md
  - Subdirectory for-py-html-css-js-by-data-dashboard/
  contains: first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset
  _20250622.xlsx, .gitignore

  Key Observations:
  1. The new command is very similar to the existing
  generate command but downloads 2 additional files from
   a subdirectory
  2. All existing functionality must remain intact
  3. The script follows a clear pattern with
  if-elif-else structure for subcommand routing
  4. Error handling includes cleanup on failure and
  proper exit codes

  Questions for clarification:
  None - the requirements are clear and complete.

  Would you like me to move to the next mode (INNOVATE)?

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm potential approaches for adding
  the generate-html-data-dashboard subcommand while
  maintaining all existing functionality.

  Approach Options

  Option 1: Duplicate and Extend the generate Logic

  Concept: Copy the entire generate subcommand logic and
   add the two additional file downloads at the end

  Advantages:
  - Simple and straightforward
  - Minimal risk to existing functionality
  - Easy to understand and maintain
  - Follows the existing pattern of independent
  subcommand blocks

  Disadvantages:
  - Code duplication (the 4 root files download logic is
   repeated)
  - If the root file list changes, need to update in two
   places
  - Slightly longer script

  Option 2: Extract Common Logic into a Function

  Concept: Create a shared function for downloading the
  4 root files, then call it from both generate and
  generate-html-data-dashboard

  Advantages:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  - Single source of truth for root file downloads
  - Cleaner code structure

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires refactoring existing working code
  - Adds complexity with function calls
  - Deviates from the current flat structure where all
  subcommands are self-contained
  - Higher risk of breaking existing generate command

  Option 3: Add Conditional Logic to generate Command

  Concept: Modify the existing generate command to
  accept an optional flag or detect the command name
  variant

  Advantages:
  - Single code path to maintain
  - Most compact implementation

  Disadvantages:
  - Changes existing command behavior
  - More complex conditional logic
  - Higher risk of breaking existing functionality
  - Less clear separation of concerns

  Recommended Approach

  I recommend Option 1: Duplicate and Extend

  Rationale:
  1. Preserves existing functionality: Zero changes to
  the current generate command
  2. Matches existing architecture: The script currently
   uses self-contained if-elif blocks for each
  subcommand
  3. Lower risk: No refactoring of working code
  4. Clear intent: Each subcommand is explicit and
  independent
  5. Easy testing: Can test the new command without
  touching existing commands
  6. Follows project history: The context shows the
  script evolved with independent, self-contained
  subcommands

  Implementation considerations:
  - Add new elif block before the final else statement
  - Copy the generate logic but extend the FILES array
  to include the 2 additional files with subdirectory
  paths
  - Update the GitHub URL construction to handle
  subdirectory paths
  - Maintain identical error handling and cleanup
  patterns
  - Update the usage message to include the new command

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode with this
  approach?
