  I've read the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol and understand I must follow the
  strict mode-based workflow. I've also read the command generation
  requirements.

  Based on my analysis, this is a methodology repository for ICMwRIPER-5
  (Iterative Context Management with RIPER-5), which is a human-AI
  collaboration framework. The repository currently contains:

  - Template files for iterations
  - The RIPER-5 protocol specification
  - Example iteration files
  - No executable code, scripts, or build tools

  Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file:

● Write(CLAUDE.md)

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
     working with code in this repository.
     ## Repository Purpose
     This is the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology repository - a structured
     framework for human-AI collaboration in software development. It is
     NOT a software project with code to build or test. Instead, it
     provides:
     1. **RIPER-5 Protocol** (`icmwriper-5.md`) - Strict operational rules
      requiring AI to work in 5 distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE, PLAN,
     EXECUTE, and REVIEW
     2. **Template Files** - Starting points for new iterations:
     … +42 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Created CLAUDE.md focusing on the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol requirements and
  file structure. Since this is a methodology repository without
  executable code, the guidance emphasizes the critical mode-based
  workflow and naming conventions rather than build/test commands.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5 workflow to complete
  the command generation requirement. I've already read both files. Let me
   clarify my understanding:

  Requirement Summary:
  Create an executable command icmwriper-5 for WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 that:
  - Runs as icmwriper-5 generate <project-name>
  - Creates a folder named <project-name> in current directory
  - Copies 4 files from GitHub repo
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5:
    - icm-bubble-template.md
    - icm-story-template.md
    - icmwriper-5.md
    - README.md
  - Renames the copied README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md

  Questions to clarify before proceeding:

  1. Should the command be installed globally (e.g., in /usr/local/bin/)
  or locally in user's home directory (e.g., ~/.local/bin/)?
  2. What should happen if the <project-name> folder already exists?
  3. What should happen if the GitHub repository is unreachable?
  4. Should the command support any other subcommands besides generate, or
   just error on unknown commands?

  I'm ready to move to INNOVATE mode once you confirm these details or
  tell me to proceed with reasonable defaults.

> 1. Should the command be installed globally (e.g., in /usr/local/bin/)
  or locally in user's home directory (e.g., ~/.local/bin/)?
  A: globally, please.

  2. What should happen if the <project-name> folder already exists?
  A: report the issue and quit the command.

  3. What should happen if the GitHub repository is unreachable?
  A:  report the issue and quit the command.

  4. Should the command support any other subcommands besides generate, or
   just error on unknown commands?
   A: please report the error on unknown commands and quit the command.

  Thank you for the clarifications. Let me gather additional information
  about the system:

● Bash(ls -la /usr/local/bin/ | head -10)
  ⎿  total 36                                    
     drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 28 18:58 .
     drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Aug  6 00:55 ..
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which git curl wget)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/git 
     /usr/bin/curl
     /usr/bin/wget

● Bash(bash --version | head -1)
  ⎿  GNU bash, version 5.2.21(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Good. The system has curl, git, and wget available, and /usr/local/bin/
  exists (requires sudo for installation). I can see similar command
  patterns already installed there.

  Research complete. Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode.

  Awaiting your signal: "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"

> ENTER INNOVATE MODE 

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm different approaches for implementing the
  icmwriper-5 command:

  Approach 1: Bash Script with curl

  - Pros: Simple, uses widely available tools, no additional dependencies
  - Cons: Less robust error handling, manual file downloading
  - Method: Download each file individually using curl from raw GitHub
  URLs

  Approach 2: Bash Script with git clone (temporary)

  - Pros: Atomic operation, all files fetched together, automatically
  handles repository structure
  - Cons: Downloads entire repository (including .git), requires cleanup,
  slower
  - Method: Clone repo to temp directory, copy needed files, delete temp
  directory

  Approach 3: Bash Script with git sparse-checkout

  - Pros: Only downloads needed files, cleaner than full clone
  - Cons: More complex implementation, requires Git 2.25+
  - Method: Use sparse-checkout to fetch only the 4 required files

  Approach 4: Python Script

  - Pros: Better error handling, more readable code structure
  - Cons: Requires Python dependency, needs shebang configuration
  - Method: Use requests or urllib to download files

  Recommendation

  I suggest Approach 1 (Bash Script with curl) because:
  1. It's simple and direct
  2. No additional dependencies beyond curl (already available)
  3. Fast execution (only downloads 4 small files)
  4. Easy to understand and maintain
  5. Follows the pattern of existing commands in /usr/local/bin/

  The script would:
  - Parse command-line arguments
  - Validate that the subcommand is "generate"
  - Check if target directory exists
  - Download each file using curl with error checking
  - Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md
  - Provide clear error messages at each step

  Ready to proceed to PLAN mode if you approve this approach, or would you
   prefer a different approach?
