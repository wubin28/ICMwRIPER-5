● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the current state of
  the project by reading the referenced
  files and examining the existing codebase
  structure. Let me gather the necessary
  information.

● Based on my research, I now have a
  complete understanding of the project
  context. Let me summarize what I've
  learned:

  Observations

  Four Story-Bubble Pairs Completed:

  1. Pair 1 (2025-10-01): Created the
  icmwriper-5 generate command
  2. Pair 2 (2025-10-02): Updated README
  with installation guide
  3. Pair 3 (2025-10-02): Added icmwriper-5 
  story subcommand
  4. Pair 4 (2025-10-03): Updated
  icmwriper-5 bubble subcommand to use
  latest story timestamp

  Current Implementation Status:

  The /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwri
  per-5 script (119 lines) now supports:
  - generate <project-name>: Downloads
  template files from GitHub
  - story <story-name>: Creates timestamped
  copy of story file
  - bubble <bubble-name>: Creates
  timestamped bubble file matching the
  latest story file's timestamp

  Technical Details:

  - Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows
  11
  - Language: Bash shell script
  - GitHub repo:
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5
  - Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  - File naming: icm-story-<timestamp>.md,
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md

  Key Design Decisions:

  - Bubble files align their timestamp with
  the latest story file (not current system
  time)
  - Story references in bubble files are
  automatically updated via sed
  - All subcommands include error handling
  and validation

  Questions

  1. Should the snapshot file include the
  exact bash script implementation, or just
  describe its functionality?
  2. Should I document the bubble files in
  the bubbles/ directory (conversation
  logs), or focus only on the final script
  and requirements?
  3. What level of technical detail is
  needed for the next AI tool - high-level
  architecture or line-by-line
  implementation details?

> 1. Should the snapshot file include the
  exact bash script implementation, or just

A: First describe its functionality, then 
describe the exact bash script 
implementation briefly. 

  2. Should I document the bubble files in
  the bubbles/ directory (conversation
  logs), or focus only on the final script
  and requirements?
  A: Please focus only on the final script 
and requirements.
  
  3. What level of technical detail is
  needed for the next AI tool - high-level
  architecture or line-by-line
  implementation details?
A: high-level architecture please.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. Now I
  have all the information needed to
  understand the requirements:

  1. Snapshot should describe functionality
  first, then provide brief implementation
  details
  2. Focus on final script and requirements
  only (not conversation logs)
  3. Use high-level architecture approach
  (not line-by-line details)

  Complete Understanding

  I have gathered all necessary information
  about:

  - ✓ The 4 completed story-bubble pairs and
   their requirements
  - ✓ The current icmwriper-5 script
  implementation (3 subcommands)
  - ✓ Technical stack: Bash script on WSL2
  Ubuntu 24.04
  - ✓ Key design decisions: timestamp
  alignment, sed-based updates
  - ✓ Project purpose: ICMwRIPER-5
  methodology framework
  - ✓ File naming conventions and structure
  - ✓ GitHub repository source

  The current task is to create
  icm-snapshot-2025-10-03--19-45.md file
  that documents:
  1. Business requirements implemented
  2. Technical architecture decisions
  3. Script functionality overview
  4. High-level implementation details

  I am ready to proceed to the next mode
  when you signal.
