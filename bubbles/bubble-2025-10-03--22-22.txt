  state to fulfill your request. Let me read
   the referenced files to gather
  information about:

  1. The story-bubble pair you mentioned
  2. The bubbles directory content after the
   timestamp "2025-10-03--19-45"
  3. The current context file
  4. The implemented script

● Based on my research of the bubbles
  directory and files, I now have a complete
   understanding of the project. I can see
  that:

  1. The "snb" subcommand has been
  successfully implemented in the previous
  iteration (story-bubble pair
  2025-10-03--20-43)
  2. The current script (icmwriper-5) now
  has 167 lines with 4 subcommands:
  generate, story, bubble, and snb

  Now I understand your request: You want me
   to generate a new context file
  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md that
  describes:
  - The newly implemented "snb" business
  requirement
  - The technical decisions made during
  implementation

  Let me proceed with ENTER INNOVATE MODE to
   brainstorm the approach.

> ENTER INNOVATE MODE 

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll explore different approaches for
  creating the updated context file
  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md.

  Approach 1: Incremental Update

  Build upon the existing context file
  (icm-context-2025-10-03--19-45.md) by
  adding only the new "snb" subcommand
  information.

  Advantages:
  - Minimal duplication
  - Clear what changed since last context
  - Faster to create and read

  Disadvantages:
  - Readers need to reference both files to
  get complete picture
  - May lose coherence of the overall
  architecture

  Approach 2: Complete Replacement

  Create a comprehensive new context file
  that includes everything from the previous
   context plus the new "snb" functionality.

  Advantages:
  - Self-contained, complete picture in one
  file
  - Easy for new AI tools to understand full
   context
  - Maintains consistency with the layered
  documentation approach used before

  Disadvantages:
  - More content duplication
  - Longer document

  Approach 3: Hybrid Approach

  Start with a brief summary of what's new,
  then provide complete updated sections for
   areas that changed (like subcommands
  list, script statistics), while keeping
  unchanged sections concise.

  Advantages:
  - Highlights what's new while maintaining
  completeness
  - Balances readability with
  comprehensiveness
  - Good for both quick scanning and
  detailed reference

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires careful organization to avoid
  confusion

  Content Considerations

  What to include for the "snb" subcommand:

  Business Requirement:
  - User workflow improvement: create both
  story and bubble files in one command
  - Ensures timestamp consistency between
  paired files
  - Reduces manual steps

  Technical Decisions:
  1. Inline implementation approach - Why it
   was chosen over function extraction or
  command chaining
  2. Single timestamp generation - Both
  files use the same timestamp (different
  from bubble command)
  3. Sed pattern enhancement - Supporting
  both numeric timestamps and template
  placeholders (yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm)
  4. Cleanup strategy - Removing story file
  if bubble creation fails
  5. Template hardcoding - Always uses
  icm-bubble-template.md (not parameterized)

  Updated metrics:

  - Script now has 167 lines (up from 119)
  - 4 subcommands (was 3)
  - 5 iterations completed (was 4)

  Recommendation

  I recommend Approach 2 (Complete 
  Replacement) because:

  1. Aligns with your original request to
  provide "complete context for another AI
  tool"
  2. Maintains the successful layered
  documentation structure from the previous
  context
  3. Single file is easier to reference with
   @icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md
  4. The document isn't excessively long
  even with full content
  5. Follows the same structure makes it
  easy to see what changed by comparing
  files

  The document should follow the same
  layered structure:
  - Executive Summary (updated stats)
  - Business Requirements (add snb workflow)
  - Technical Architecture (update
  subcommand list, add snb design decisions)
  - Implementation Details (add snb
  subcommand section)
  - Usage Examples (add snb example)
  - Context for AI Tools (update iteration
  count)
  - Metadata (update timestamps and stats)

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode
  with this complete replacement approach?

  3. Detailed Content Specification

  Section 1: Header and Executive Summary

  Section title: # ICMwRIPER-5 Project 
  Context

  Subsection: ## Executive Summary

  Content elements:
  1. Project Name: "ICMwRIPER-5 Command-Line
   Tool"
  2. Current Status: "Functional with 4
  subcommands implemented" (updated from 3)
  3. Purpose: "A bash-based CLI tool for
  managing ICMwRIPER-5 methodology projects,
   providing project initialization and
  timestamped file management for
  story-bubble iteration pairs"
  4. Platform: "WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows
   11"
  5. Script Location: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/IC
  MwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5
  6. Quick Capabilities (4 items):
    - Generate new projects with template
  files from GitHub
    - Create timestamped story files
    - Create timestamped bubble files with
  automatic story reference updates
    - NEW: Create matched story-bubble file
  pairs in a single command

  Section 2: Business Requirements 
  Implemented

  Section title: ## Business Requirements 
  Implemented

  Subsection 1: ### Project Initialization
  - Requirement: Users need to quickly
  bootstrap new ICMwRIPER-5 projects
  - Solution: icmwriper-5 generate 
  <project-name> command
  - What it provides: Downloads 4 template
  files from GitHub repository
  - Files downloaded:
  icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md,
  README.md (renamed to
  icmwriper-5-README.md)

  Subsection 2: ### Iteration Management
  - Requirement: Users need to create
  timestamped story-bubble file pairs for
  each development iteration
  - Story creation: icmwriper-5 story 
  <story-name> creates
  icm-story-<timestamp>.md
  - Bubble creation: icmwriper-5 bubble 
  <bubble-name> creates
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
  - Key behavior: Bubble files automatically
   use the timestamp from the most recent
  story file (not current system time)

  NEW Subsection 3: ### Combined 
  Story-Bubble Creation
  - Requirement: Users need a streamlined
  way to create both story and bubble files
  simultaneously with guaranteed timestamp
  consistency
  - Solution: icmwriper-5 snb <story-name>
  command (SNB = Story aNd Bubble)
  - What it does:
    - Copies the specified story file with
  current timestamp
    - Copies icm-bubble-template.md with the
   same timestamp
    - Updates story references in the bubble
   file
  - Key difference from separate commands:
  Both files share identical timestamp,
  ensuring perfect pairing
  - Workflow improvement: Reduces from 2
  commands to 1 command

  Subsection 4: ### Automatic Reference 
  Management
  - Requirement: Bubble files must reference
   their corresponding story files
  - Solution: Both bubble and snb commands
  automatically update story file references
   using pattern matching
  - Pattern matching: Supports both numeric
  timestamps (e.g., 2025-10-03--21-43) and
  template placeholders (e.g.,
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm)
  - Example: Replaces
  @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md with
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--22-01.md

  Section 3: Technical Architecture

  Section title: ## Technical Architecture

  Subsection 1: ### Technology Stack
  - Language: Bash shell script
  (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
  - Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04
  - External dependencies: curl (for file
  downloads), sed (for text replacement),
  date (for timestamps)
  - Source repository:
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5

  Subsection 2: ### File Naming Conventions
  - Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  (e.g., 2025-10-03--22-01)
  - Generation command: date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - Story files: icm-story-<timestamp>.md
  - Bubble files: icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
  - Todo files: todo-<timestamp>.md (created
   during PLAN mode)

  Subsection 3: ### Script Architecture
  - Command pattern: icmwriper-5 
  <subcommand> <argument>
  - Routing structure: if-elif-else
  subcommand dispatcher
  - Supported subcommands: generate, story,
  bubble, snb (4 total, updated from 3)
  - Error handling: All operations validate
  inputs and provide descriptive error
  messages with exit code 1
  - Success handling: All operations output
  confirmation messages with exit code 0

  Subsection 4: ### Key Design Decisions

  Decision 1: Bubble timestamp matches story
   timestamp (existing)
  - Rationale: Story and bubble files form
  conceptual pairs for each iteration
  - Implementation: The bubble command finds
   the latest icm-story-*.md file using ls 
  -t and extracts its timestamp
  - Benefit: File pairs are easily
  identifiable by matching timestamps

  Decision 2: Automatic story reference
  updates (existing, enhanced)
  - Rationale: Bubble files reference their
  corresponding story files; manual updates
  are error-prone
  - Implementation: Uses sed with enhanced
  regex pattern to replace old story
  references with the latest/new story
  filename
  - Enhanced pattern: s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{
  4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9
  ]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$TARGET/g
  - Pattern supports: Both numeric
  timestamps AND template placeholder format

  Decision 3: Download from GitHub raw URLs
  (existing)
  - Rationale: Ensures users always get the
  latest template files without manual
  copying
  - Implementation: Uses curl to fetch from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/
  ICMwRIPER-5/main/
  - Error handling: Cleans up partial
  directories if any download fails

  NEW Decision 4: SNB command uses inline
  implementation
  - Rationale: Maintains consistency with
  existing code structure; allows precise
  timestamp control
  - Alternative considered: Function
  extraction or recursive command chaining
  - Why inline was chosen:
    - Self-contained logic, easy to
  understand
    - No dependencies between subcommands
    - Allows both files to use identical
  timestamp
    - Matches existing pattern where each
  subcommand is independent

  NEW Decision 5: SNB hardcodes bubble
  template filename
  - Rationale: Simplifies command syntax;
  99% use case is the template file
  - Implementation: Always uses
  icm-bubble-template.md
  - User only specifies the story source
  file
  - Trade-off: Less flexibility, but clearer
   user experience

  NEW Decision 6: SNB cleanup strategy on
  failure
  - Rationale: Avoid orphaned story files if
   bubble creation fails
  - Implementation: If bubble file copy
  fails, the already-created story file is
  removed with rm -f
  - Benefit: Maintains consistency; either
  both files are created or neither

  Section 4: Implementation Details

  Section title: ## Implementation Details

  Introduction paragraph: "The icmwriper-5
  script (167 lines) implements four
  subcommands with consistent error handling
   and validation patterns."

  Subsection 1: ### generate Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Creates new project directory
  - Downloads 4 template files from GitHub
  - Renames README.md to
  icmwriper-5-README.md

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate that project directory doesn't
   already exist
  2. Create directory with mkdir
  3. Loop through file array, downloading
  each with curl -f -sS -o
  4. If any download fails, remove entire
  directory and exit
  5. Rename README file with mv
  6. Output success message

  Key validation:
  - Directory existence check before
  creation
  - Curl failure detection with cleanup
  - Exactly 2 arguments required

  Subsection 2: ### story Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Copies a source story file
  - Renames it with current timestamp
  - Appends .md extension

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate source file exists
  2. Generate timestamp using date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  3. Construct target filename:
  icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md
  4. Copy file with cp
  5. Output success message

  Key validation:
  - Source file existence check
  - Copy operation error handling

  Subsection 3: ### bubble Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Copies a source bubble file
  - Renames it using the timestamp from the
  latest story file
  - Updates story file references within the
   copied file

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate source file exists
  2. Find latest story file: ls -t 
  icm-story-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
  3. Validate that at least one story file
  exists
  4. Extract timestamp using bash parameter
  expansion:
    - Remove prefix:
  ${LATEST_STORY#icm-story-}
    - Remove suffix: ${TIMESTAMP%.md}
  5. Construct target filename:
  icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md
  6. Copy file with cp
  7. Replace story references using enhanced
   sed pattern (supports both numeric
  timestamps and yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  placeholder)
  8. Output success message showing which
  story file was referenced

  Key validation:
  - Source file existence check
  - Story file existence check (must have at
   least one)
  - Copy operation error handling

  Key technical details:
  - Uses ls -t to sort by modification time
  (newest first)
  - Uses bash parameter expansion for
  efficient string manipulation
  - Enhanced sed regex: Matches both numeric
   timestamps and template placeholder
  format

  NEW Subsection 4: ### snb Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Creates matched story-bubble file pair
  with identical timestamp
  - Copies specified story file with current
   timestamp
  - Copies icm-bubble-template.md with the
  same timestamp
  - Updates story references in the bubble
  file

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate source story file exists
  2. Validate that icm-bubble-template.md
  exists
  3. Generate single timestamp using date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M" (used for both files)
  4. Define both target filenames:
    - STORY_TARGET="icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    -
  BUBBLE_TARGET="icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md"
  5. Copy story file with cp
  6. Copy bubble template file with cp
    - If this fails, cleanup the story file
  with rm -f and exit
  7. Replace story references using enhanced
   sed pattern
  8. Output two success messages (one for
  story, one for bubble)

  Key validation:
  - Source story file existence check
  - Bubble template file existence check
  - Story copy error handling
  - Bubble copy error handling with cleanup

  Key technical details:
  - Single timestamp generation ensures
  perfect pairing
  - Cleanup strategy prevents orphaned files
  - Sed pattern identical to bubble command
  - Hardcoded bubble template filename for
  simplicity

  Error handling flow:
  - If story file doesn't exist → exit with
  error, no files created
  - If template doesn't exist → exit with
  error, no files created
  - If story copy fails → exit with error,
  no files created
  - If bubble copy fails → remove story
  file, exit with error

  Section 5: Usage Examples

  Section title: ## Usage Examples

  Section 6: Context for AI Tools

  Section title: ## Context for AI Tools

  Content:
  "This context was created after completing
   5 story-bubble iteration pairs. The
  script is fully functional and has been
  tested on WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04. When
  continuing development:

  - The script file is located at /home/wzb/
  OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5
  - Follow the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology
  documented in icmwriper-5.md
  - Maintain the existing error handling
  patterns (validate inputs, provide clear
  error messages, exit with code 1 on
  failure)
  - Keep timestamp format consistent:
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  - Test all file operations with proper
  error handling and cleanup
  - The enhanced sed pattern supports both
  numeric timestamps and the
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm template placeholder

  The methodology requires AI tools to work
  in 5 distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE,
  PLAN, EXECUTE, and REVIEW. Always declare
  your current mode at the start of each
  response."
