● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the current state of
  the project before proceeding. Let me read
   the context file and examine the existing
   implementation.

● RESEARCH Summary

  I have gathered the following information:

  Current system understanding:

  1. Script location: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/IC
  MwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 (119 lines, bash
  script)
  2. Existing commands implemented:
    - icmwriper-5 generate <project-name> -
  Creates new project with template files
  from GitHub
    - icmwriper-5 story <story-name> -
  Copies story file with timestamp
    - icmwriper-5 bubble <bubble-name> -
  Copies bubble file using latest story
  timestamp and updates references
  3. Business requirement (from
  icm-story-2025-10-03--20-43.md):
    - Create a new command: icmwriper-5 snb 
  <story-name>
    - This new command should combine the
  functionality of:
        i. First execute icmwriper-5 story 
  <story-name> operations
      ii. Then execute icmwriper-5 bubble 
  <icm-bubble-template.md> operations
    - All existing functionality must
  continue to work
  4. File patterns observed:
    - Story files:
  icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md
    - Bubble files:
  icm-bubble-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md
    - Template files: icm-story-template.md,
   icm-bubble-template.md
  5. Current implementation details:
    - Script uses if-elif-else structure for
   subcommand routing
    - Requires exactly 2 arguments
    - Story command: copies source file to
  timestamped name
    - Bubble command: finds latest story
  file, extracts its timestamp, copies
  bubble file with same timestamp, updates
  story references

  Questions for clarification:

  1. Should the snb command accept
  <story-name> as the story file to copy
  (similar to how story command works)?
  2. Should the bubble template file always
  be icm-bubble-template.md, or should it be
   configurable?
  3. Should the snb command create both
  files with the same timestamp (similar to
  how bubble currently works)?

> 1. Should the snb command accept
  <story-name> as the story file to copy
  (similar to how story command works)? A: 
Yes, it should.
  2. Should the bubble template file always
  be icm-bubble-template.md, or should it be
   configurable? A: It should always be 
icm-bubble-template.md.
  3. Should the snb command create both
  files with the same timestamp (similar to
  how bubble currently works)? A: Yes, it 
should. 

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. Let me
  verify my complete understanding by
  examining the current usage pattern:

● Bash(head -20 /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/
      icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  #!/usr/bin/env bash           

     # Argument count validation
     … +19 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● RESEARCH Complete

  I now have a complete understanding:

  New snb command requirements:
  - Command syntax: icmwriper-5 snb 
  <story-name>
  - Behavior:
    a. Generate a timestamp (current time)
    b. Copy <story-name> to
  icm-story-<timestamp>.md (like story
  command)
    c. Copy icm-bubble-template.md to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md (using the SAME
  timestamp from step 2)
    d. Update story references in the bubble
   file to point to the newly created story
  file
    e. Output success messages for both
  operations

  Key implementation insight:
  - Unlike the current bubble command which
  finds the latest existing story file, the
  snb command will create BOTH files with a
  NEW timestamp
  - The bubble file will reference the story
   file just created in the same operation

  Preservation requirement:
  - All existing commands (generate, story,
  bubble) must continue to work exactly as
  before
  - The usage message needs to be updated to
   include snb

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll explore different approaches for
  implementing the snb command.

  Approach 1: Inline Implementation 
  (Recommended)

  Add a new elif branch for the snb
  subcommand that duplicates the logic from
  both story and bubble commands inline.

  Advantages:
  - Self-contained logic, easy to understand
  - No dependencies between subcommands
  - Simple to maintain and debug
  - Follows the existing pattern in the
  script

  Disadvantages:
  - Some code duplication (timestamp
  generation, file copying, error messages)
  - Slightly increases script length

  Approach 2: Function Extraction

  Extract common logic into shell functions
  (e.g., copy_with_timestamp(),
  update_story_references()) and call them
  from both existing commands and the new
  snb command.

  Advantages:
  - Reduces code duplication
  - More maintainable if logic needs to
  change
  - Cleaner separation of concerns

  Disadvantages:
  - Increases complexity for a relatively
  simple script
  - Deviates from current straightforward
  if-elif-else structure
  - May be over-engineering for this use
  case

  Approach 3: Command Chaining

  Make the snb command internally call the
  existing story and bubble logic by
  invoking the script recursively.

  Advantages:
  - Maximum code reuse
  - Ensures identical behavior to separate
  commands

  Disadvantages:
  - Recursive script invocation is complex
  and fragile
  - Would require parsing output to extract
  the created filenames
  - Timestamp synchronization would be
  difficult (story creates one timestamp,
  bubble finds latest)
  - Goes against the requirement that both
  files should have the SAME timestamp

  Recommendation

  Approach 1 (Inline Implementation) is the
  best choice because:
  1. It maintains consistency with the
  existing code structure
  2. It's straightforward to implement and
  understand
  3. It allows precise control over the
  timestamp used for both files
  4. It matches the existing pattern where
  each subcommand is self-contained
  5. The script is still small enough that
  moderate duplication is acceptable

  signal.

● [MODE: PLAN]

  Technical Specification for snb Subcommand
   Implementation

  1. File to Modify

  - File: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/ic
  mwriper-5
  - Current lines: 119
  - Modification type: Add new subcommand
  handler

  2. Changes Required

  Change 1: Update Usage Message

  Location: Line 5

  Current code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate 
  <project-name> | story <story-name> | 
  bubble <bubble-name>}"

  New code:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate 
  <project-name> | story <story-name> | 
  bubble <bubble-name> | snb <story-name>}"

  Change 2: Add snb Subcommand Handler

  Location: After line 114 (after the bubble
   command handler's closing), before line
  115 (before the else clause)

  Insert new code block:
  elif [ "$1" = "snb" ]; then
      # SNB (Story aNd Bubble) subcommand 
  handler
      # Store story name
      STORY_NAME="$2"

      # Check if source story file exists
      if [ ! -f "$STORY_NAME" ]; then
          echo "Error: File '$STORY_NAME' 
  does not exist."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Check if bubble template exists
      if [ ! -f "icm-bubble-template.md" ];
  then
          echo "Error: File 
  'icm-bubble-template.md' does not exist."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Generate timestamp (will be used for
   both files)
      TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")

      # Define target filenames
      STORY_TARGET="icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md"

  BUBBLE_TARGET="icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md"

      # Copy story file
      if ! cp "$STORY_NAME" "$STORY_TARGET";
   then
          echo "Error: Failed to copy 
  '$STORY_NAME' to '$STORY_TARGET'."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Copy bubble file
      if ! cp "icm-bubble-template.md"
  "$BUBBLE_TARGET"; then
          echo "Error: Failed to copy 
  'icm-bubble-template.md' to 
  '$BUBBLE_TARGET'."
          # Cleanup: remove the story file 
  that was already created
          rm -f "$STORY_TARGET"
          exit 1
      fi

      # Replace the story reference with the
   newly created story filename
      sed -i "s/@icm-story-[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\
  {2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\.md
  /@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

      # Success message
      echo "Success: Copied '$STORY_NAME' to
   '$STORY_TARGET'."
      echo "Success: Copied 
  'icm-bubble-template.md' to 
  '$BUBBLE_TARGET' and updated story 
  reference to '$STORY_TARGET'."
      exit 0

  Change 3: Update Error Message for Unknown
   Commands

  Location: Line 116

  Current code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. 
  Supported commands: 'generate', 'story', 
  'bubble'."

  New code:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. 
  Supported commands: 'generate', 'story', 
  'bubble', 'snb'."

  3. Implementation Logic Flow

  SNB command execution flow:
  1. Validate that <story-name> file exists
  2. Validate that icm-bubble-template.md
  exists
  3. Generate single timestamp using date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  4. Define both target filenames using the
  same timestamp
  5. Copy story file to
  icm-story-<timestamp>.md
  6. Copy bubble template to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
    - If this fails, cleanup the story file
  and exit
  7. Update story references in the bubble
  file using sed
  8. Output two success messages (one for
  story, one for bubble)

  4. Error Handling

  Error cases:
  1. Source story file doesn't exist → Exit
  with error message
  2. Bubble template doesn't exist → Exit
  with error message
  3. Story copy fails → Exit with error
  message
  4. Bubble copy fails → Remove story file
  (cleanup), then exit with error message

  Cleanup strategy: If bubble file creation
  fails after story file is created, remove
  the story file to maintain consistency.

  5. Testing Scenarios

  Test 1: Normal operation
  - Command: icmwriper-5 snb 
  icm-story-template.md
  - Expected: Creates both files with same
  timestamp, updates reference

  Test 2: Story file doesn't exist
  - Command: icmwriper-5 snb nonexistent.md
  - Expected: Error message, no files
  created

  Test 3: Bubble template doesn't exist
  - Command: icmwriper-5 snb 
  icm-story-template.md (after removing
  template)
  - Expected: Error message, no files
  created

  Test 4: Verify existing commands still 
  work
  - icmwriper-5 story icm-story-template.md
  → Should work
  - icmwriper-5 bubble 
  icm-bubble-template.md → Should work
  - icmwriper-5 generate test-project →
  Should work

  6. Final Script Structure

  After implementation, the script will
  have:
  - Lines 1-114: Existing code (with updated
   usage message)
  - Lines 115-160 (approx): New snb
  subcommand handler
  - Lines 161-164 (approx): Else clause for
  unknown commands (with updated message)
