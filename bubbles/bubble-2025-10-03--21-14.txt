● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the current state of
  the project before proceeding. Let me read
   the context file and examine the existing
   implementation.

● Read(icm-context-2025-10-03--19-45.md)
  ⎿  Read 233 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "icmwriper-5*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "*.sh")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Let me read the main script to understand
  the current implementation:

● Read(icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Read 119 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check if there are any existing
   story files in the directory to
  understand the file structure better:

● Bash(ls -la icm-*.md)
  ⎿  -rw-r--r-- 1 wzb wzb  174 Oct  1 19:30
     icm-bubble-2025-10-01--19-13.md
     -rw-r--r-- 1 wzb wzb  174 Oct  2 10:02
     … +27 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me examine one of the story files
  to see the typical content structure:

● Read(icm-story-2025-10-03--16-22.md)
  ⎿  Read 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-03--16-22.md)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● RESEARCH Summary

  I have gathered the following information:

  Current system understanding:

  1. Script location: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/IC
  MwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 (119 lines, bash
  script)
  2. Existing commands implemented:
    - icmwriper-5 generate <project-name> -
  Creates new project with template files
  from GitHub
    - icmwriper-5 story <story-name> -
  Copies story file with timestamp
    - icmwriper-5 bubble <bubble-name> -
  Copies bubble file using latest story
  timestamp and updates references
  3. Business requirement (from
  icm-story-2025-10-03--20-43.md):
    - Create a new command: icmwriper-5 snb 
  <story-name>
    - This new command should combine the
  functionality of:
        i. First execute icmwriper-5 story 
  <story-name> operations
      ii. Then execute icmwriper-5 bubble 
  <icm-bubble-template.md> operations
    - All existing functionality must
  continue to work
  4. File patterns observed:
    - Story files:
  icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md
    - Bubble files:
  icm-bubble-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md
    - Template files: icm-story-template.md,
   icm-bubble-template.md
  5. Current implementation details:
    - Script uses if-elif-else structure for
   subcommand routing
    - Requires exactly 2 arguments
    - Story command: copies source file to
  timestamped name
    - Bubble command: finds latest story
  file, extracts its timestamp, copies
  bubble file with same timestamp, updates
  story references

  Questions for clarification:

  1. Should the snb command accept
  <story-name> as the story file to copy
  (similar to how story command works)?
  2. Should the bubble template file always
  be icm-bubble-template.md, or should it be
   configurable?
  3. Should the snb command create both
  files with the same timestamp (similar to
  how bubble currently works)?

> 1. Should the snb command accept

Yes, it should.
  2. Should the bubble template file always
  be icm-bubble-template.md, or should it be
   configurable? A: It should always be 
icm-bubble-template.md.
  3. Should the snb command create both
  files with the same timestamp (similar to
  how bubble currently works)? A: Yes, it 
should. 

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. Let me
  verify my complete understanding by
  examining the current usage pattern:

● Bash(head -20 /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/
      icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  #!/usr/bin/env bash           

     # Argument count validation
     … +19 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● RESEARCH Complete

  I now have a complete understanding:

  New snb command requirements:
  - Command syntax: icmwriper-5 snb 
  <story-name>
  - Behavior:
    a. Generate a timestamp (current time)
    b. Copy <story-name> to
  icm-story-<timestamp>.md (like story
  command)
    c. Copy icm-bubble-template.md to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md (using the SAME
  timestamp from step 2)
    d. Update story references in the bubble
   file to point to the newly created story
  file
    e. Output success messages for both
  operations

  Key implementation insight:
  - Unlike the current bubble command which
  finds the latest existing story file, the
  snb command will create BOTH files with a
  NEW timestamp
  - The bubble file will reference the story
   file just created in the same operation

  Preservation requirement:
  - All existing commands (generate, story,
  bubble) must continue to work exactly as
  before
  - The usage message needs to be updated to
   include snb

  Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode when you
   signal.
