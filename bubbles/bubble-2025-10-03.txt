@icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md。 
  ⎿  Read icmwriper-5.md (109 lines)
  ⎿ Read icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md (1

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I'm reading the requirement to understand
  what needs to be done. Let me examine the
  current @icmwriper-5 command
  implementation to see how it works.

● Search(pattern: "**/icmwriper-5*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5

● Bash(type icmwriper-5)
  ⎿ icmwriper-5 is /usr/local/bin/icmwriper
    -5


● Read(/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Read 78 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see:
  1. The installed version at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5 only supports
  generate command
  2. The local version at /home/wzb/OOR/kata
  s/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 has both
  generate and story commands
  3. The requirement asks for a new bubble
  command that:
    - Takes a bubble-name as input
    - Copies the file <bubble-name> to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
    - Replaces 命令生成需求详见 
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md with
  命令生成需求详见 @<副本文件名>

  Questions:
  1. Should the bubble command work
  similarly to the story command (copy and
  rename)?
  2. Should I modify the local version at /h
  ome/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5?

1. Should the bubble command work
  similarly to the story command (copy and
  rename)?
A: yes.

  2. Should I modify the local version at /h
  ome/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5?
A: yes.
