<目的>
请严格按照ICMwRIPER-5工作流程完成业务需求。
ICMwRIPER-5工作流程详见 @icmwriper-5.md。

<输出>
创建Python代码时，请先在venv目录中创建虚拟环境，然后在此环境中安装依赖包并运行代
码。虚拟环境目录名必须为venv，不可使用其他名称。
</输出>
<顾虑>
如在过程中需要sudo密码（例如安装Python依赖包时），请提示我手动操作的命令。等我手
工完成这些操作后再继续。请勿为简化流程而自行更改计划。

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I've read the context and understand the requirements. Let me now research the
  current codebase to understand the existing implementation before proceeding.

● I have read the context and examined the current codebase. Now let me
  understand what needs to be done:

  Current Situation:
  - The icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script has 5 subcommands: generate,
  generate-html-data-dashboard, story, bubble, and snb
  - The script is 223 lines long

  New Requirement from icm-story-2025-10-11--22-25.md:
  - Add a new bubble subcommand (but wait, there's already a bubble subcommand!)
  - Looking more carefully at the Chinese requirement, it seems to be asking for
  something different

  Let me re-read the story file more carefully:

  The requirement says:
  1. Command format: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu bubble
  2. Step 1: Create an empty bubble file named bubble-<timestamp>.md in the
  current directory

  Clarification Questions:

  1. Naming conflict: There is already a bubble subcommand that creates
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md files. The new requirement wants to create
  bubble-<timestamp>.md files (without the "icm-" prefix). Is this:
    - A completely separate subcommand with a different name?
    - A replacement for the existing bubble subcommand?
    - An additional feature to be added to the existing bubble subcommand?
  2. File content: The requirement says to create an "empty markdown file"
  (空markdown文件). Should this be:
    - A completely empty file (0 bytes)?
    - A file with basic markdown structure (like headers)?
    - Similar to the current bubble template?
  3. Relationship to story files: The current bubble subcommand:
    - Uses the timestamp from the latest icm-story-*.md file
    - Updates story references inside the bubble file

  Does the new functionality need these features, or should it just create a
  simple empty file with a timestamp?

  Could you please clarify these points so I can better understand the exact
  requirement?
