● Based on my research, I now have a
  complete understanding of the project
  context. Let me summarize what I've
  learned:

  Observations

  Four Story-Bubble Pairs Completed:

  1. Pair 1 (2025-10-01): Created the
  icmwriper-5 generate command
  2. Pair 2 (2025-10-02): Updated README
  with installation guide
  3. Pair 3 (2025-10-02): Added icmwriper-5 
  story subcommand
  4. Pair 4 (2025-10-03): Updated
  icmwriper-5 bubble subcommand to use
  latest story timestamp

  Current Implementation Status:

  The /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwri
  per-5 script (119 lines) now supports:
  - generate <project-name>: Downloads
  template files from GitHub
  - story <story-name>: Creates timestamped
  copy of story file
  - bubble <bubble-name>: Creates
  timestamped bubble file matching the
  latest story file's timestamp

  Technical Details:

  - Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows
  11
  - Language: Bash shell script
  - GitHub repo:
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5
  - Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  - File naming: icm-story-<timestamp>.md,
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md

  Key Design Decisions:

  - Bubble files align their timestamp with
  the latest story file (not current system
  time)
  - Story references in bubble files are
  automatically updated via sed
  - All subcommands include error handling
  and validation

  Questions

  1. Should the snapshot file include the
  exact bash script implementation, or just
  describe its functionality?
  2. Should I document the bubble files in
  the bubbles/ directory (conversation
  logs), or focus only on the final script
  and requirements?
  3. What level of technical detail is
  needed for the next AI tool - high-level
  architecture or line-by-line
  implementation details?

A: First describe its functionality, then 
describe the exact bash script 
implementation briefly. 

  2. Should I document the bubble files in
  the bubbles/ directory (conversation
  logs), or focus only on the final script
  and requirements?
  A: Please focus only on the final script 
and requirements.
  
  3. What level of technical detail is
  needed for the next AI tool - high-level
  architecture or line-by-line
  implementation details?
A: high-level architecture please.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. Now I
  have all the information needed to
  understand the requirements:

  1. Snapshot should describe functionality
  first, then provide brief implementation
  details
  2. Focus on final script and requirements
  only (not conversation logs)
  3. Use high-level architecture approach
  (not line-by-line details)

  Complete Understanding

  I have gathered all necessary information
  about:

  - ✓ The 4 completed story-bubble pairs and
   their requirements
  - ✓ The current icmwriper-5 script
  implementation (3 subcommands)
  - ✓ Technical stack: Bash script on WSL2
  Ubuntu 24.04
  - ✓ Key design decisions: timestamp
  alignment, sed-based updates
  - ✓ Project purpose: ICMwRIPER-5
  methodology framework
  - ✓ File naming conventions and structure
  - ✓ GitHub repository source

  The current task is to create
  icm-snapshot-2025-10-03--19-45.md file
  that documents:
  1. Business requirements implemented
  2. Technical architecture decisions
  3. Script functionality overview
  4. High-level implementation details

  I am ready to proceed to the next mode
  when you signal.

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll explore different approaches for
  creating the snapshot document that will
  help another AI tool understand the
  project context.

  Possible Approaches for Snapshot Structure

  Approach 1: Chronological Evolution

  - Document the 4 iterations in order (Pair
   1 → Pair 2 → Pair 3 → Pair 4)
  - Show how each iteration built upon the
  previous one
  - Advantages: Clear historical
  progression, easy to understand evolution
  - Disadvantages: May be verbose, requires
  reading entire history to understand
  current state

  Approach 2: Current State First

  - Start with final implementation status
  - Then explain the business context and
  technical decisions
  - Reference the iterations as supporting
  context
  - Advantages: Immediate clarity on what
  exists now, faster onboarding
  - Disadvantages: May lose context on why
  certain decisions were made

  Approach 3: Feature-Centric

  - Organize by the three subcommands
  (generate, story, bubble)
  - For each feature: business requirement →
   technical implementation → design
  rationale
  - Advantages: Modular, easy to understand
  individual features
  - Disadvantages: May fragment the overall
  architecture understanding

  Approach 4: Layered Documentation

  - Layer 1: Executive summary (what exists,
   what it does)
  - Layer 2: Business requirements (why it
  was built)
  - Layer 3: Technical architecture (how it
  works)
  - Layer 4: Implementation details (script
  structure)
  - Advantages: Allows different depth
  levels, comprehensive yet scannable
  - Disadvantages: Longer document, more
  effort to maintain

  Content Considerations

  What to Include

  - Essential: Current script capabilities,
  technical stack, file naming conventions
  - Important: Design decisions (timestamp
  alignment, sed updates), error handling
  patterns
  - Helpful: GitHub repo URL, platform
  requirements, typical usage patterns
  - Optional: Future enhancement
  possibilities, known limitations

  What to Exclude (per your guidance)

  - Conversation logs from bubbles/
  directory
  - Line-by-line code analysis
  - Detailed todo lists from each iteration
  - Step-by-step implementation history

  Questions for Consideration

  Which approach would best serve a new AI
  tool picking up this project? I'm inclined
   toward Approach 4 (Layered Documentation)
   because it provides:
  - Quick overview for initial context
  - Deeper technical details when needed
  - Clear separation between "what/why/how"
  - Easy for another AI to scan and extract
  relevant sections

  Would you prefer a different approach, or
  should I proceed with the layered
  structure?

    Cursor

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Perfect! Let me explore how to structure
  the layered documentation in more detail.

  Detailed Layer Structure for Approach 4

  Layer 1: Executive Summary

  Possible elements:
  - Project name and purpose (ICMwRIPER-5
  command-line tool)
  - Current version/status (functional with
  3 subcommands)
  - Quick capability list (what the tool
  does in 2-3 sentences)
  - Target platform (WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04)

  Layer 2: Business Requirements

  Possible organization:
  - Option A: List all requirements as
  bullet points
  - Option B: Group by iteration themes
  (project setup → file management →
  automation)
  - Option C: Group by user workflow
  (initialization → iteration creation →
  maintenance)

  I'm leaning toward Option C as it helps
  the next AI understand the user's workflow
   context.

  Layer 3: Technical Architecture

  Possible sections:
  - Technology stack (Bash, GitHub raw URLs,
   sed/date/ls commands)
  - File naming conventions and timestamp
  format
  - Script structure (subcommand routing
  pattern)
  - Key design decisions:
    - Why bubble timestamp matches story
  timestamp?
    - Why use sed for reference updates?
    - Error handling philosophy

  Layer 4: Implementation Details

  Possible organization:
  - Option A: By subcommand (generate,
  story, bubble)
  - Option B: By functionality type
  (validation, file operations, timestamp
  handling)
  - Option C: Chronological (what was added
  in each iteration)

  I prefer Option A (by subcommand) because
  it matches how the script is actually
  structured and makes it easy to understand
   or modify individual features.

  Additional Considerations

  Should the snapshot include:

  - Usage examples? (Yes - helps AI
  understand expected behavior)
  - Error scenarios? (Yes - shows validation
   logic)
  - GitHub repository context? (Yes - needed
   for generate command)
  - Future extension points? (Maybe - could
  help AI suggest improvements)

  Document format options:

  - Standard markdown with clear headings
  - Could add a "Quick Reference" box at the
   top
  - Could include a "Context for AI Tools"
  section explaining how to use this
  snapshot

  Would you like me to proceed to PLAN mode
  with this layered structure (Executive
  Summary → Business Requirements →
  Technical Architecture → Implementation
  Details), organized with Layer 2 using
  workflow grouping and Layer 4 organized by
   subcommand?

  /icm-snapshot-2025-10-03--19-45.md

  Target audience: Another AI tool + LLM
  combination that will continue development

  Document language: English

  Detailed Content Specification

  Layer 1: Executive Summary

  Section title: # ICMwRIPER-5 Project 
  Snapshot

  Subsection: ## Executive Summary

  Content to include:
  1. Project name: "ICMwRIPER-5 Command-Line
   Tool"
  2. Current status: "Functional with 3
  subcommands implemented"
  3. Purpose statement: "A bash-based CLI
  tool for managing ICMwRIPER-5 methodology
  projects, providing project initialization
   and timestamped file management for
  story-bubble iteration pairs"
  4. Platform: "WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows
   11"
  5. Script location: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/IC
  MwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5
  6. Quick capabilities list:
    - Generate new projects with template
  files from GitHub
    - Create timestamped story files
    - Create timestamped bubble files with
  automatic story reference updates

  Layer 2: Business Requirements

  Section title: ## Business Requirements 
  Implemented

  Organization: By user workflow

  Subsection 1: ### Project Initialization
  - Requirement: Users need to quickly
  bootstrap new ICMwRIPER-5 projects
  - Solution: icmwriper-5 generate 
  <project-name> command
  - What it provides: Downloads 4 template
  files from GitHub repository
  - Files downloaded:
  icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md,
  README.md (renamed to
  icmwriper-5-README.md)

  Subsection 2: ### Iteration Management
  - Requirement: Users need to create
  timestamped story-bubble file pairs for
  each development iteration
  - Story creation: icmwriper-5 story 
  <story-name> creates
  icm-story-<timestamp>.md
  - Bubble creation: icmwriper-5 bubble 
  <bubble-name> creates
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
  - Key behavior: Bubble files automatically
   use the timestamp from the most recent
  story file (not current system time)

  Subsection 3: ### Automatic Reference 
  Management
  - Requirement: Bubble files must reference
   their corresponding story files
  - Solution: The bubble command
  automatically updates story file
  references using pattern matching
  - Example: Replaces
  @icm-story-2025-10-02--09-50.md with
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--05-38.md (the
  latest story file)

  Layer 3: Technical Architecture

  Section title: ## Technical Architecture

  Subsection 1: ### Technology Stack
  - Language: Bash shell script
  (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
  - Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04
  - External dependencies: curl (for file
  downloads), sed (for text replacement),
  date (for timestamps)
  - Source repository:
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5

  Subsection 2: ### File Naming Conventions
  - Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  (e.g., 2025-10-03--19-45)
  - Generation command: date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - Story files: icm-story-<timestamp>.md
  - Bubble files: icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
  - Todo files: todo-<timestamp>.md (created
   during PLAN mode)

  Subsection 3: ### Script Architecture
  - Command pattern: icmwriper-5 
  <subcommand> <argument>
  - Routing structure: if-elif-else
  subcommand dispatcher
  - Supported subcommands: generate, story,
  bubble
  - Error handling: All operations validate
  inputs and provide descriptive error
  messages with exit code 1
  - Success handling: All operations output
  confirmation messages with exit code 0

  Subsection 4: ### Key Design Decisions

  Decision 1: Bubble timestamp matches story
   timestamp
  - Rationale: Story and bubble files form
  conceptual pairs for each iteration
  - Implementation: The bubble command finds
   the latest icm-story-*.md file using ls 
  -t and extracts its timestamp
  - Benefit: File pairs are easily
  identifiable by matching timestamps

  Decision 2: Automatic story reference
  updates
  - Rationale: Bubble files reference their
  corresponding story files; manual updates
  are error-prone
  - Implementation: Uses sed with regex
  pattern to replace old story references
  with the latest story filename
  - Pattern: @icm-story-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0
  -9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}.md

  Decision 3: Download from GitHub raw URLs
  - Rationale: Ensures users always get the
  latest template files without manual
  copying
  - Implementation: Uses curl to fetch from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/
  ICMwRIPER-5/main/
  - Error handling: Cleans up partial
  directories if any download fails

  Layer 4: Implementation Details

  Section title: ## Implementation Details

  Introduction paragraph: "The icmwriper-5
  script (119 lines) implements three
  subcommands with consistent error handling
   and validation patterns."

  Subsection 1: ### generate Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Creates new project directory
  - Downloads 4 template files from GitHub
  - Renames README.md to
  icmwriper-5-README.md

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate that project directory doesn't
   already exist
  2. Create directory with mkdir
  3. Loop through file array, downloading
  each with curl -f -sS -o
  4. If any download fails, remove entire
  directory and exit
  5. Rename README file with mv
  6. Output success message

  Key validation:
  - Directory existence check before
  creation
  - Curl failure detection with cleanup
  - Exactly 2 arguments required

  Subsection 2: ### story Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Copies a source story file
  - Renames it with current timestamp
  - Appends .md extension

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate source file exists
  2. Generate timestamp using date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  3. Construct target filename:
  icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md
  4. Copy file with cp
  5. Output success message

  Key validation:
  - Source file existence check
  - Copy operation error handling

  Subsection 3: ### bubble Subcommand

  Functionality:
  - Copies a source bubble file
  - Renames it using the timestamp from the
  latest story file
  - Updates story file references within the
   copied file

  Implementation approach:
  1. Validate source file exists
  2. Find latest story file: ls -t 
  icm-story-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
  3. Validate that at least one story file
  exists
  4. Extract timestamp using bash parameter
  expansion:
    - Remove prefix:
  ${LATEST_STORY#icm-story-}
    - Remove suffix: ${TIMESTAMP%.md}
  5. Construct target filename:
  icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md
  6. Copy file with cp
  7. Replace story references: sed -i 
  "s/@icm-story-[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\
  {2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\.md/@$LATEST_S
  TORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
  8. Output success message showing which
  story file was referenced

  Key validation:
  - Source file existence check
  - Story file existence check (must have at
   least one)
  - Copy operation error handling

  Key technical detail:
  - Uses ls -t to sort by modification time
  (newest first)
  - Uses bash parameter expansion for
  efficient string manipulation
  - Sed regex matches exact timestamp
  pattern format

  Additional Section: Usage Examples

  Section title: ## Usage Examples

  Example 1: Creating a new project
  $ icmwriper-5 generate my-kata-project
  Success: Project 'my-kata-project' created
   with ICMwRIPER-5 template files.

  Example 2: Creating a story file
  $ icmwriper-5 story icm-story-template.md
  Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to
   'icm-story-2025-10-03--19-45.md'.

  Example 3: Creating a bubble file
  $ icmwriper-5 bubble
  icm-bubble-template.md
  Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md'
  to 'icm-bubble-2025-10-03--19-45.md' and
  updated story reference to
  'icm-story-2025-10-03--19-45.md'.

  Additional Section: Context for AI Tools

  Section title: ## Context for AI Tools

  Content:
  "This snapshot was created after
  completing 4 story-bubble iteration pairs.
   The script is fully functional and has
  been tested on WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04. When
  continuing development:

  - The script file is located at /home/wzb/
  OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5
  - Follow the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology
  documented in icmwriper-5.md
  - Maintain the existing error handling
  patterns (validate inputs, provide clear
  error messages, exit with code 1 on
  failure)
  - Keep timestamp format consistent:
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
  - Test all file operations with proper
  error handling and cleanup

  The methodology requires AI tools to work
  in 5 distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE,
  PLAN, EXECUTE, and REVIEW. Always declare
  your current mode at the start of each
  response."
