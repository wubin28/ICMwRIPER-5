<输出>
创建Python代码时，请先在venv目录中创建虚拟环境，然后在此环境中安装依赖包并运行代
码。虚拟环境目录名必须为venv，不可使用其他名称。
</输出>
<顾虑>
如在过程中需要sudo密码（例如安装Python依赖包时），请提示我手动操作的命令。等我手
工完成这些操作后再继续。请勿为简化流程而自行更改计划。

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I've read the context and understand the requirements. Let me now research the
  current codebase to understand the existing implementation before proceeding.

● I have read the context and examined the current codebase. Now let me
  understand what needs to be done:

  Current Situation:
  - The icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script has 5 subcommands: generate,
  generate-html-data-dashboard, story, bubble, and snb
  - The script is 223 lines long

  New Requirement from icm-story-2025-10-11--22-25.md:
  - Add a new bubble subcommand (but wait, there's already a bubble subcommand!)
  - Looking more carefully at the Chinese requirement, it seems to be asking for
  something different

  Let me re-read the story file more carefully:

  The requirement says:
  1. Command format: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu bubble
  2. Step 1: Create an empty bubble file named bubble-<timestamp>.md in the
  current directory

  Clarification Questions:

  1. Naming conflict: There is already a bubble subcommand that creates
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md files. The new requirement wants to create
  bubble-<timestamp>.md files (without the "icm-" prefix). Is this:
    - A completely separate subcommand with a different name?
    - A replacement for the existing bubble subcommand?
    - An additional feature to be added to the existing bubble subcommand?
  2. File content: The requirement says to create an "empty markdown file"
  (空markdown文件). Should this be:
    - A completely empty file (0 bytes)?
    - A file with basic markdown structure (like headers)?
    - Similar to the current bubble template?
  3. Relationship to story files: The current bubble subcommand:
    - Uses the timestamp from the latest icm-story-*.md file
    - Updates story references inside the bubble file

  Does the new functionality need these features, or should it just create a
  simple empty file with a timestamp?

  Could you please clarify these points so I can better understand the exact
  requirement?

    - An additional feature to be added to the existing bubble subcommand?
A: It's a completely separate subcommand with a different name. I've changed the 
sub-command name to "bubble-log" in the story @icm-story-2025-10-11--22-25.md.

A: It's just create a simple empty file with a timestamp.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Now I understand the requirement
  clearly:

  Requirement Summary:
  - Add a new bubble-log subcommand (separate from existing bubble subcommand)
  - Command: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu bubble-log
  - Creates an empty file named bubble-<timestamp>.md using current system
  timestamp
  - No relationship to story files
  - No template content - just a 0-byte empty file
  - All existing functionality must remain unchanged

  Let me examine the existing script structure to understand how to implement
  this:

● Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● Bash(wc -l /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  222 /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu

● Perfect! I have now completed my research. I understand:

  Current Script Structure:
  - The script has argument validation that expects exactly 2 arguments (lines
  4-7)
  - There are 5 existing subcommands: generate, story, bubble, snb,
  generate-html-data-dashboard
  - The script uses an if-elif-else chain for routing (lines 10-222)
  - Each subcommand is self-contained
  - Error handling is consistent across all subcommands
  - The script is 222 lines long

  What needs to be added:
  - A new bubble-log subcommand
  - It should NOT require a second argument (just the subcommand name)
  - Creates an empty file bubble-<timestamp>.md in the current directory using
  touch
  - Uses current system timestamp (not from story files)
  - Simple and straightforward - no validation, no templates, no story references

  Key observations:
  1. Argument validation issue: Line 4 checks if [ $# -ne 2 ] - this means ALL
  commands currently require exactly 2 arguments. The new bubble-log command
  should work with just 1 argument (the subcommand name only). This needs to be
  modified.
  2. Usage message: Line 5 lists all commands - needs to add bubble-log
  3. Error message: Line 220 lists supported commands - needs to add bubble-log
  4. Routing: Need to add a new elif branch for bubble-log

  I'm ready to proceed to the next mode when you signal.
