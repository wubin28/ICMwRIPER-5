● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I've read the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol and understand I must follow the
  strict mode-based workflow. I've also read the command generation
  requirements.

  Let me understand what exists in the current directory:

● Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 48

● Bash(which icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Error: icmwriper-5 not found

● Bash(echo $PATH)
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Based on my analysis, this is a methodology repository for ICMwRIPER-5
  (Iterative Context Management with RIPER-5), which is a human-AI
  collaboration framework. The repository currently contains:

  - Template files for iterations
  - The RIPER-5 protocol specification
  - Example iteration files
  - No executable code, scripts, or build tools

  Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file:

● Write(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 52 lines to CLAUDE.md                                         
     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
     working with code in this repository.
     ## Repository Purpose
     This is the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology repository - a structured
     framework for human-AI collaboration in software development. It is
     NOT a software project with code to build or test. Instead, it
     provides:
     1. **RIPER-5 Protocol** (`icmwriper-5.md`) - Strict operational rules
      requiring AI to work in 5 distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE, PLAN,
     EXECUTE, and REVIEW
     2. **Template Files** - Starting points for new iterations:
     … +42 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Created CLAUDE.md focusing on the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol requirements and
  file structure. Since this is a methodology repository without
  executable code, the guidance emphasizes the critical mode-based
  workflow and naming conventions rather than build/test commands.
