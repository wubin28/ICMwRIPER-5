● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I'm reading the requirement to understand
  what needs to be done. Let me examine the
  current @icmwriper-5 command
  implementation to see how it works.

● Search(pattern: "**/icmwriper-5*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5

● Bash(type icmwriper-5)
  ⎿ icmwriper-5 is /usr/local/bin/icmwriper
    -5


● Read(/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(icmwriper-5)
  ⎿  Read 78 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see:
  1. The installed version at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5 only supports
  generate command
  2. The local version at /home/wzb/OOR/kata
  s/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 has both
  generate and story commands
  3. The requirement asks for a new bubble
  command that:
    - Takes a bubble-name as input
    - Copies the file <bubble-name> to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
    - Replaces 命令生成需求详见 
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md with
  命令生成需求详见 @<副本文件名>

  Questions:
  1. Should the bubble command work
  similarly to the story command (copy and
  rename)?
  2. Should I modify the local version at /h
  ome/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5?

A: yes.

  2. Should I modify the local version at /h

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Understood. Now I need to check if there
  are any existing bubble files to
  understand the text replacement pattern
  better.

● Search(pattern: "**/*bubble*.md")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 112                             
     drwxr-xr-x 5 wzb wzb 4096 Oct  3 05:12
     .
     … +42 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-03--04-06.md)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I understand the complete requirement:

  Current State:
  - Local script /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIP
  ER-5/icmwriper-5 has generate and story
  commands
  - Bubble files contain the text:
  命令生成需求详见 
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md

  Required New Functionality:
  - Add a bubble subcommand
  - When running icmwriper-5 bubble 
  <bubble-name>:
    a. Copy file <bubble-name> to
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
    b. Replace 命令生成需求详见 
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md with
  命令生成需求详见 @<副本文件名> (where
  <副本文件名> is the new filename like
  icm-bubble-2025-10-03--04-06.md)

  Ready to move to the next mode when
  instructed.

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now let me consider different approaches
  for implementing the bubble subcommand:

  Approach 1: Direct sed replacement 
  (similar to story command)

  - Copy the file first
  - Use sed to perform in-place text
  replacement
  - Replace the exact pattern
  命令生成需求详见 
  @icm-story-2025-10-03--04-01.md with
  命令生成需求详见 @<new-filename>
  - Advantage: Simple, follows existing
  pattern
  - Disadvantage: Hard-coded pattern might
  not match all cases

  Approach 2: Pattern-based replacement with
   regex

  - Copy the file first
  - Use sed with a regex pattern like
  命令生成需求详见 @icm-story-.*\.md
  - Replace with 命令生成需求详见 
  @<new-filename>
  - Advantage: More flexible, handles
  different story filenames
  - Disadvantage: Might replace unintended
  text if pattern is too broad

  Approach 3: Generic story reference 
  replacement

  - Copy the file first
  - Use sed to find any @icm-story- pattern
  and replace the entire reference
  - Advantage: Most flexible for future use
  - Disadvantage: Same risk of
  over-replacement

  Recommendation

  Approach 2 seems most appropriate because:
  - It's more robust than hard-coding a
  specific story filename
  - It maintains the same level of
  specificity (only matches @icm-story-*.md
  patterns)
  - Follows the bash scripting style already
   used in the script

  Which approach would you prefer, or should
   I proceed with Approach 2?

> I'd prefer approach 2. 

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Understood. I'll proceed with Approach 2
  using regex-based pattern replacement to
  match any @icm-story-*.md reference and
  replace it with the new bubble filename.

  Ready to move to PLAN mode when
  instructed.

  DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

  File to Modify

  - /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwripe
  r-5

  Changes Required

  1. Update Usage Message (Line 5)

  Current:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate 
  <project-name> | story <story-name>}"

  New:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate 
  <project-name> | story <story-name> | 
  bubble <bubble-name>}"

  2. Add bubble subcommand handler (After 
  line 73, before the else block)

  Insert a new elif block between the story
  subcommand and the final else:

  Location: After line 73 (after the story
  command's exit 0)

  Code to insert:
  elif [ "$1" = "bubble" ]; then
      # Bubble subcommand handler
      # Store bubble name
      BUBBLE_NAME="$2"

      # Check if source file exists
      if [ ! -f "$BUBBLE_NAME" ]; then
          echo "Error: File '$BUBBLE_NAME' 
  does not exist."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Generate timestamp
      TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")

      # Define target filename
      TARGET_FILE="icm-bubble-$TIMESTAMP.md"

      # Copy file
      if ! cp "$BUBBLE_NAME" "$TARGET_FILE";
   then
          echo "Error: Failed to copy 
  '$BUBBLE_NAME' to '$TARGET_FILE'."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Replace the story reference with the
   new bubble filename
      sed -i "s/@icm-story-[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\
  {2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\.md
  /@$TARGET_FILE/g" "$TARGET_FILE"

      # Success message
      echo "Success: Copied '$BUBBLE_NAME' 
  to '$TARGET_FILE' and updated story 
  reference."
      exit 0

  3. Update error message (Line 75)

  Current:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. 
  Supported commands: 'generate', 'story'."

  New:
  echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. 
  Supported commands: 'generate', 'story', 
  'bubble'."

  Implementation Logic

  The bubble subcommand will:
  1. Accept a <bubble-name> parameter
  2. Validate that the source file exists
  3. Generate a timestamp in format
  YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM
  4. Create target filename as
  icm-bubble-<timestamp>.md
  5. Copy the source file to the target
  filename
  6. Use sed with regex pattern
  @icm-story-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}--[0-
  9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\.md to find and replace the
   story reference
  7. Replace it with @<target-filename>
  (e.g., @icm-bubble-2025-10-03--04-06.md)
  8. Output success message

  Regex Pattern Explanation

  - Pattern: @icm-story-[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\
  }-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\.md
  - This matches:
  @icm-story-YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM.md
  - Uses basic regex syntax (escaped braces
  for sed)
  - Replaces with: @$TARGET_FILE where
  TARGET_FILE contains the new bubble
  filename
