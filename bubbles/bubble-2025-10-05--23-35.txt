✻ Thinking…

  The user has referenced the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol by mentioning 
  @icmwriper-5.md and @icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md. According to the
   protocol I read from the file, I MUST:

  1. Begin EVERY response with mode declaration in brackets
  2. Follow the strict operational protocol
  3. Start in RESEARCH mode unless explicitly told to enter another 
  mode

  The user wants me to convert a Ubuntu script to work on macOS. The 
  business requirements are in the story file that was read 
  automatically. Let me analyze what I have:

  From icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md:
  - The project has implemented 4 subcommands (generate, story, bubble,
   snd) for the @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu command in Windows 11 WSL2 
  Ubuntu 24.04
  - They want me to read @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md and the 
  @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script
  - Copy the script and rename it to icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - Convert it to work on macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 in iTerm2 with zsh
  - Maintain all functionality of the 4 subcommands

  Since no explicit mode transition was given, I should start in 
  RESEARCH mode and focus ONLY on understanding what exists, not 
  suggesting implementations.

  I need to:
  1. Read the context file mentioned
  2. Read the Ubuntu script
  3. Understand the current implementation
  4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

  Let me start with RESEARCH mode.

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the existing Ubuntu script and context
  before proceeding. Let me read the referenced files to understand
   the current implementation.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The context file doesn't exist (there might be a typo in the 
  filename), but I found the Ubuntu script. Let me read it to 
  understand the current implementation.

⏺ Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I now understand the Ubuntu script. Let me also check if there might 
  be a context file with a different filename pattern to get more 
  information.

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icm-context*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Found the context files! The one referenced in the story has a typo 
  (2925 instead of 2025). Let me read the correct context file.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Read 333 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a complete understanding of the current Ubuntu script and 
  its functionality. Let me also examine the template files to 
  understand the full context:

⏺ Search(pattern: "*template*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I've now gathered all the information I need to understand the 
  current Ubuntu script implementation. Let me summarize what I 
  learned:

  Ubuntu Script Analysis (icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu):

  1. Language: Bash shell script with shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
  2. Commands: 4 subcommands - generate, story, bubble, snb
  3. Functionality:
    - generate: Creates new project directory and downloads template 
  files from GitHub
    - story: Copies story file with current timestamp
    - bubble: Copies bubble file with timestamp from latest story file 
   
    - snb: Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical timestamp

  Key Ubuntu-specific dependencies identified:

  - curl for downloading files
  - sed for text replacement (with -i flag for in-place editing)
  - date for timestamp generation 
  - Basic file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls)

  Potential macOS compatibility issues to consider:

  1. sed -i behavior differs between GNU sed (Linux) and BSD sed 
  (macOS)
  2. date command formatting may differ
  3. File system case sensitivity differences
  4. ls sorting behavior
  5. curl availability and options

  Since I'm in RESEARCH mode, I should focus ONLY on understanding and 
  ask clarifying questions if needed.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the Ubuntu script and context files, I
  now understand the current implementation:

  Current Ubuntu Script Analysis

  Script: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu (167 lines)
  Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04Functionality: 4 subcommands
  implemented

  Subcommands:

  1. generate - Creates project directory, downloads 4 template
  files from GitHub
  2. story - Copies story file with current timestamp
  (icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md)
  3. bubble - Copies bubble file using timestamp from latest story
  file, updates story references
  4. snb - Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical
  timestamp

  Key Dependencies Identified:

  - curl for GitHub file downloads
  - sed -i for in-place text replacement
  - date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M" for timestamp generation
  - Standard file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls -t)

  Critical Functions:

  - File existence validation
  - Timestamp extraction from filenames
  - Pattern matching for story reference updates
  - Error handling with cleanup

  Questions for Clarification:

  1. Context file reference: The story mentions
  @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md but the actual file is
  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md (typo in year). Should I proceed
   with the 2025 version?
  2. macOS environment details: You mentioned macOS Sequoia 15.6.1
  with iTerm2 and zsh. Should I assume standard macOS command-line
  tools or do you have any custom installations (like GNU coreutils
   via Homebrew)?
  3. Sudo requirements: The script downloads files and creates
  directories. Are there any specific permissions or locations
  where sudo might be needed that I should be aware of?
  4. GitHub access: The script downloads from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main/.
  Should I assume internet connectivity and GitHub access will work
   the same way on macOS?

  I understand the complete functionality and am ready to proceed
  once you provide any clarifications needed.

RIPER-5。

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. I now have all the information
  needed:

  1. Using the 2025 context file ✓
  2. Standard macOS command-line tools ✓
  3. Will prompt for sudo commands when needed ✓
  4. Internet/GitHub access works on macOS ✓
  5. I only need to modify the local script (not the GitHub
  repository) ✓

  I notice the story file mentions snd as one of the 4 subcommands,
   but analyzing the actual script, it's snb (Story aNd Bubble).
  I'll proceed with the actual implementation which is snb.

  Key Differences Between Ubuntu and macOS

  From my analysis, the main compatibility issues that need
  addressing for macOS are:

  1. sed -i behavior: Ubuntu uses sed -i while macOS requires sed 
  -i '' for in-place editing
  2. date command: Both should work the same with date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  3. File operations: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls should work identically
  4. curl: Should work the same on both platforms
  5. Bash arrays and parameter expansion: Should work identically
  in both environments

  The primary change needed is the sed -i syntax modification for
  macOS compatibility.

  Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode when you give the signal.

⏺ [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Potential Approaches for macOS Script Conversion

  Approach 1: Minimal Modification Strategy

  - Copy the Ubuntu script exactly and only change the
  macOS-incompatible parts
  - Primary change: sed -i to sed -i '' for in-place editing
  - Rename script from icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu to
  icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - Keep all logic, error handling, and structure identical

  Advantages:
  - Minimal risk of introducing bugs
  - Maintains proven functionality
  - Easy to verify correctness by comparison
  - Quick implementation

  Disadvantages:
  - Doesn't optimize for macOS-specific features
  - Script name in usage message would need updating

  Approach 2: macOS-Optimized Implementation

  - Leverage macOS-specific command features where beneficial
  - Consider using BSD-style command options that might be more
  native
  - Potentially improve error messages for macOS context
  - Update internal references and documentation

  Advantages:
  - More native macOS experience
  - Could potentially improve performance or compatibility

  Disadvantages:
  - Higher risk of introducing differences in behavior
  - More complex testing required
  - May diverge from proven Ubuntu implementation

  Approach 3: Universal Script with Platform Detection

  - Create a single script that detects the platform and adjusts
  behavior
  - Use uname or similar to detect macOS vs Linux
  - Conditional logic for platform-specific commands

  Advantages:
  - Single script maintains both platforms
  - Reduces maintenance overhead

  Disadvantages:
  - More complex logic
  - Goes beyond the simple "copy and convert" requirement
  - May introduce unexpected behavior

  Approach 4: Hybrid Approach

  - Start with Approach 1 (minimal modification)
  - Add macOS-specific improvements only where they provide clear
  benefits
  - Focus on user experience improvements (like updated usage
  messages)

  Advantages:
  - Balances safety with optimization
  - Allows for targeted improvements

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires more decision-making about what to change

  Recommendation

  I recommend Approach 1: Minimal Modification Strategy because:

  1. Safety first: The Ubuntu script is proven and functional
  2. Clear requirements: The task asks to "convert" the existing
  script while maintaining "all functionality"
  3. Predictable outcome: Minimal changes mean minimal risk
  4. Easy verification: Simple to compare and validate

  The main changes would be:
  - Script filename: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu → icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - sed syntax: sed -i → sed -i '' (two locations in the script)
  - Usage message: Update script name reference

  This approach ensures the script works identically on macOS while
   making only the necessary platform-specific adjustments.

⏺ [MODE: PLAN]

  Technical Specification for macOS Script Conversion

  Objective

  Convert the existing Ubuntu script icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu to a
  macOS-compatible version named icmwriper-5-for-macos using
  minimal modifications while preserving all functionality.

  Analysis of Required Changes

  Primary Compatibility Issue:
  - Ubuntu: sed -i "pattern" file (in-place editing)
  - macOS: sed -i '' "pattern" file (requires empty string after -i
   flag)

  Affected Lines:
  - Line 111: sed -i 
  "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9
  ]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
  - Line 157: sed -i 
  "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9
  ]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g"
  "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

  Secondary Changes:
  - Line 5: Update usage message script name reference
  - Script filename: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu → icmwriper-5-for-macos

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  2. Target file:
  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos
  3. Operation: Copy then modify in-place

  Specific Code Changes

  Change 1: Usage Message (Line 5)
  # FROM:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | story 
  <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb <story-name>}"

  \{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g"
  "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

  Verification Strategy

  - All other commands (curl, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls, date) work
  identically on macOS
  - File permissions and executable bit will be preserved during
  copy
  - Script structure and logic remain completely unchanged
  - Error handling patterns remain identical

  No Changes Required For:

  - Shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env bash (works on both platforms)
  - File operations: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls -t
  - Date command: date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - Curl command and options
  - Bash arrays and parameter expansion
  - All validation and error handling logic
  - Exit codes and success messages

      /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos
      story icm-story-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to 'icm-story-2025-10-
    05--23-28.md'.


⏺ Let's verify the story file was created:

⏺ Bash(ls -la test-macos-project/icm-story-*.md)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):1: no matches found: 
     test-macos-project/icm-story-*.md

⏺ Let me check what files exist in the test project:

⏺ Bash(ls -la test-macos-project/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: test-macos-project/: No such file or directory

⏺ It seems the test project directory is in the wrong location. Let
   me find it:

⏺ Bash(find /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/ -name
      "test-macos-project" -type d)
  ⎿  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project

⏺ Let me check the files in the correct location:

⏺ Bash(ls -la
      /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project/)
  ⎿  total 72

     drwxr-xr-x@ 45 binwu  staff   1440 Oct  5 23:28 ..
     … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The story file was created successfully:
  icm-story-2025-10-05--23-28.md

  Test 3: Bubble subcommand

⏺ Bash(/Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos
      bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-1
    0-05--23-28.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025
    -10-05--23-28.md'.



⏺ Excellent! The bubble command worked correctly and used the
  timestamp from the existing story file. Let me verify the bubble
  file was created:

⏺ Bash(ls -la icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff  870 Oct  5 23:28 icm-bubble-2025-1
    0-05--23-28.md


⏺ Let's verify the story reference was updated correctly in the
  bubble file:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md。

⏺ I notice the story reference wasn't updated properly. Let me
  check what happened. The script reported success, but the file
  still shows the template placeholder. Let me check if there's an
  issue with the sed command by testing it manually:

⏺ Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Let me check in the correct directory:

⏺ Bash(find /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/ -name
      "icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md")
  ⎿ /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project/ic
    m-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md


⏺ I think there's confusion about the working directory. Let me
  check the bubble file that was actually created:

⏺ Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5 && pwd && ls -la
      icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md 2>/dev/null || echo "File not
      found in main directory")
  ⎿  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5
     File not found in main directory

⏺ Let me check what files exist in the main directory and test
  again with proper working directory:

⏺ Bash(rm -rf test-macos-project)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me test the bubble command properly in the main directory
  where the template files exist:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos story icm-story-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to 'icm-story-2025-10-
    05--23-32.md'.


⏺ Now test the bubble command:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-1
    0-05--23-32.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025
    -10-05--23-32.md'.



⏺ Great! Now let's verify the story reference was actually updated:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-32.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md。

⏺ The sed command isn't working properly. Let me debug this by
  testing the sed command manually with the actual pattern:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed
      's/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9
      ]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@test-replacement/…)
  ⎿  @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md

⏺ The sed pattern is not matching. Let me check if the issue is
  with the extended regex. On macOS, sed uses basic regex by
  default. Let me test with a simpler pattern first:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed
      's/@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\.md/@test-replacement/g')
  ⎿  @test-replacement

⏺ The issue is that macOS sed doesn't support the extended regex
  \{n\} quantifiers in basic mode. I need to use extended regex
  mode with -E flag or use a different approach. Let me check what
  the Ubuntu version does and fix this:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed -E
      's/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy
      -mm-dd--hh-mm)\.md/@test-replacement/g')
  ⎿  @test-replacement

⏺ Perfect! The issue is that I need to use -E for extended regex
  and change the quantifier syntax from \{n\} to {n}. Let me fix
  the macOS script:

⏺ Update(icmwriper-5-for-macos)
  ⎿  Updated icmwriper-5-for-macos with 1 addition and 1 removal
       108    
       109        # Replace the story reference with the latest 
             story filename
       110        # Match both numeric timestamps and the 
             template placeholder format
       111 -      sed -i '' "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\
           -  }-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\
           -  |yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\
           -  )\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
       111 +      sed -i '' -E "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2
           +  }-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           +  )\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
       112    
       113        # Success message
       114        echo "Success: Copied '$BUBBLE_NAME' to 
             '$TARGET_FILE' and updated story reference to 
             '$LATEST_STORY'."

⏺ Now fix the second sed command as well:

⏺ Update(icmwriper-5-for-macos)
  ⎿  Updated icmwriper-5-for-macos with 1 addition and 1 removal
       154    
       155        # Replace the story reference with the newly 
             created story filename
       156        # Match both numeric timestamps and the 
             template placeholder format
       157 -      sed -i '' "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\
           -  }-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\
           -  |yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\
           -  )\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"
       157 +      sed -i '' -E "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2
           +  }-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           +  )\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"
       158    
       159        # Success message
       160        echo "Success: Copied '$STORY_NAME' to 
             '$STORY_TARGET'."

⏺ Now let's test the bubble command again to see if the sed fix
  works:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-1
    0-05--23-32.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025
    -10-05--23-32.md'.



⏺ Excellent! Now let's verify the story reference was updated
  correctly:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-32.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-32.md。

⏺ Perfect! The story reference was updated correctly from
  @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md to
  @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-32.md.

  Test 4: SNB subcommand

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos snb icm-story-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to 'icm-story-2025-10-
    05--23-33.md'.
    Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-1
    … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Let's verify both files were created with matching timestamps and
   the bubble file has the correct story reference:

⏺ Bash(ls -la icm-*-2025-10-05--23-33.md)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff   870 Oct  5 23:33 icm-bubble-2025-
    10-05--23-33.md
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff  1446 Oct  5 23:33 icm-story-2025-1
    0-05--23-33.md



⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-33.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-33.md。

⏺ Perfect! The SNB command worked correctly - both files have
  matching timestamps (23-33) and the bubble file references the
  correct story file.

  Let me also test the generate command one more time to ensure it
  still works:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos generate test-final)
  ⎿ Success: Project 'test-final' created with ICMwRIPER-5 templat
    e files.


⏺ Bash(ls -la test-final/)

     drwxr-xr-x@ 49 binwu  staff   1568 Oct  5 23:34 ..
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! All tests passed successfully. Let me clean up the
  test files and complete the testing task:

⏺ Bash(rm -rf test-final icm-*-2025-10-05--23-*.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me update the todo file with the review section:

⏺ Update(todo-2025-10-05--23-21.md)
  ⎿  Updated todo-2025-10-05--23-21.md with 53 additions and 1

        56 +  ### Implementation Summary
        57 +  
        58 +  Successfully converted `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` to
           +  `icmwriper-5-for-macos` with full functionality 
           + preserved.
        59 +  
        60 +  ### Changes Made:
        61 +  
        62 +  1. ✅ **Script copy completed**: Created 
           + `/Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper
           + -5-for-macos`
        63 +  
        64 +  2. ✅ **Usage message updated**: Changed script 
           + name reference from `icmwriper-5` to 
           + `icmwriper-5-for-macos` in line 5
        65 +  
        66 +  3. ✅ **sed commands converted for macOS 
           + compatibility**:
        67 +     - Added `-E` flag for extended regex support
        68 +     - Changed quantifier syntax from `\{n\}` to 
           + `{n}`
        69 +     - Maintained `-i ''` for in-place editing 
           + without backup
        70 +     - Both sed commands (lines 111 and 157) 
           + successfully updated
        71 +  
        72 +  4. ✅ **File permissions verified**: Script 
           + maintains executable permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`)
        73 +  
        74 +  5. ✅ **All subcommands tested successfully**:
        75 +     - `generate`: Creates project directory and 
           + downloads 4 template files from GitHub
        76 +     - `story`: Creates timestamped story files 
           + (`icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`)
        77 +     - `bubble`: Creates timestamped bubble files 
           + using latest story timestamp, updates story 
           + references
        78 +     - `snb`: Creates matched story-bubble pairs 
           + with identical timestamps
        79 +  
        80 +  ### Key Technical Fix:
        81 +  
        82 +  **Issue discovered**: macOS sed doesn't support 
           + basic regex quantifiers `\{n\}` by default
        83 +  **Solution applied**: Used extended regex mode 
           + with `-E` flag and updated quantifier syntax
        84 +  
        85 +  **Before (Ubuntu)**:
        86 +  ```bash
        87 +  sed -i "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]
           + \{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.
           + md/@$LATEST_STORY/g"
        88 +  ```
        89 +  
        90 +  **After (macOS)**:
        91 +  ```bash
        92 +  sed -i '' -E 
           + "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}
           + -[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm)\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g"
        93 +  ```
        94 +  
        95 +  ### Testing Results:
        96 +  
        97 +  All four subcommands tested and verified working 
           + correctly:
        98 +  - ✅ Usage message displays correctly
        99 +  - ✅ Generate command downloads all template files
       100 +  - ✅ Story command creates timestamped files
       101 +  - ✅ Bubble command uses story timestamps and 
           + updates references correctly
       102 +  - ✅ SNB command creates matched pairs with 
           + identical timestamps
       103 +  - ✅ Story reference replacement confirmed working
           +  in bubble files
       104 +  
       105 +  ### Conversion Status: ✅ COMPLETE
       106 +  
       107 +  The macOS script `icmwriper-5-for-macos` 
           + successfully implements all functionality from the 
           + Ubuntu version and is ready for use on macOS 
           + Sequoia 15.6.1 with iTerm2 and zsh.

⏺ Execution Summary

  Successfully converted the Ubuntu script to macOS with full
  functionality preserved. The key changes made were:

  1. Script name updates - Updated usage message to reference
  icmwriper-5-for-macos
  2. macOS sed compatibility - Added -E flag and updated regex
  syntax for macOS compatibility
  3. Preserved all functionality - All 4 subcommands (generate,
  story, bubble, snb) tested and verified working

  The most critical fix was updating the sed commands to use
  extended regex mode (-E) and changing the quantifier syntax from
  \{n\} to {n} to work with macOS sed.

  The macOS script is now fully functional and ready for use on
  macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with iTerm2 and zsh.
