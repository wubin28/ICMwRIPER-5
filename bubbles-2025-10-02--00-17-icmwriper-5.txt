  Based on my analysis, this is a methodology repository for ICMwRIPER-5
  (Iterative Context Management with RIPER-5), which is a human-AI
  collaboration framework. The repository currently contains:

  - Template files for iterations
  - The RIPER-5 protocol specification
  - Example iteration files
  - No executable code, scripts, or build tools

  Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file:

● Write(CLAUDE.md)

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
     working with code in this repository.
     ## Repository Purpose
     This is the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology repository - a structured
     framework for human-AI collaboration in software development. It is
     NOT a software project with code to build or test. Instead, it
     provides:
     1. **RIPER-5 Protocol** (`icmwriper-5.md`) - Strict operational
     rules requiring AI to work in 5 distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE,
     PLAN, EXECUTE, and REVIEW
     2. **Template Files** - Starting points for new iterations:
     … +42 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Created CLAUDE.md focusing on the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol requirements and
   file structure. Since this is a methodology repository without
  executable code, the guidance emphasizes the critical mode-based
  workflow and naming conventions rather than build/test commands.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand you want me to follow the ICMwRIPER-5 workflow to complete
   the command generation requirement. I've already read both files. Let
  me clarify my understanding:

  Requirement Summary:
  Create an executable command icmwriper-5 for WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 that:
  - Runs as icmwriper-5 generate <project-name>
  - Creates a folder named <project-name> in current directory
  - Copies 4 files from GitHub repo
  https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5:
    - icm-bubble-template.md
    - icm-story-template.md
    - icmwriper-5.md
    - README.md
  - Renames the copied README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md

  Questions to clarify before proceeding:

  1. Should the command be installed globally (e.g., in /usr/local/bin/)
  or locally in user's home directory (e.g., ~/.local/bin/)?
  2. What should happen if the <project-name> folder already exists?
  3. What should happen if the GitHub repository is unreachable?
  4. Should the command support any other subcommands besides generate,
  or just error on unknown commands?

  I'm ready to move to INNOVATE mode once you confirm these details or
  tell me to proceed with reasonable defaults.

> 1. Should the command be installed globally (e.g., in /usr/local/bin/)
  or locally in user's home directory (e.g., ~/.local/bin/)?
  A: globally, please.

  2. What should happen if the <project-name> folder already exists?
  A: report the issue and quit the command.

  3. What should happen if the GitHub repository is unreachable?
  A:  report the issue and quit the command.

  4. Should the command support any other subcommands besides generate, 
or
   just error on unknown commands?
   A: please report the error on unknown commands and quit the command.

  Thank you for the clarifications. Let me gather additional information
  about the system:

● Bash(ls -la /usr/local/bin/ | head -10)
  ⎿  total 36                                    
     drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Sep 28 18:58 .
     drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Aug  6 00:55 ..
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(which git curl wget)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/git 
     /usr/bin/curl
     /usr/bin/wget

● Bash(bash --version | head -1)
  ⎿  GNU bash, version 5.2.21(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Good. The system has curl, git, and wget available, and /usr/local/bin/
   exists (requires sudo for installation). I can see similar command
  patterns already installed there.

  Research complete. Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode.

  Awaiting your signal: "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"

> /export 
  ⎿  Conversation exported to: bubbles-2025-10-01--23-33-icmwriper-5.txt

> ENTER INNOVATE MODE 

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm different approaches for implementing the
  icmwriper-5 command:

  Approach 1: Bash Script with curl

  - Pros: Simple, uses widely available tools, no additional dependencies
  - Cons: Less robust error handling, manual file downloading
  - Method: Download each file individually using curl from raw GitHub
  URLs

  Approach 2: Bash Script with git clone (temporary)

  - Pros: Atomic operation, all files fetched together, automatically
  handles repository structure
  - Cons: Downloads entire repository (including .git), requires cleanup,
   slower
  - Method: Clone repo to temp directory, copy needed files, delete temp
  directory

  Approach 3: Bash Script with git sparse-checkout

  - Pros: Only downloads needed files, cleaner than full clone
  - Cons: More complex implementation, requires Git 2.25+
  - Method: Use sparse-checkout to fetch only the 4 required files

  Approach 4: Python Script

  - Pros: Better error handling, more readable code structure
  - Cons: Requires Python dependency, needs shebang configuration
  - Method: Use requests or urllib to download files

  Recommendation

  I suggest Approach 1 (Bash Script with curl) because:
  1. It's simple and direct
  2. No additional dependencies beyond curl (already available)
  3. Fast execution (only downloads 4 small files)
  4. Easy to understand and maintain
  5. Follows the pattern of existing commands in /usr/local/bin/

  The script would:
  - Parse command-line arguments
  - Validate that the subcommand is "generate"
  - Check if target directory exists
  - Download each file using curl with error checking
  - Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md
  - Provide clear error messages at each step

  Ready to proceed to PLAN mode if you approve this approach, or would 
  you prefer a different approach?

● [MODE: PLAN]

  Comprehensive Technical Specification for icmwriper-5 Command

  Overview

  Create a bash script that will be installed as a global command at
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5.

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  Script Structure

  File Location: /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5

  Shebang: #!/usr/bin/env bash

  Script Logic:

  1. Argument Validation
    - Check if exactly 2 arguments are provided
    - If not, print usage message: "Usage: icmwriper-5 generate " and
  exit with code 1
    - Check if first argument is "generate"
    - If not, print error: "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Only 'generate'
  is supported." and exit with code 1
    - Store second argument as PROJECT_NAME variable
  2. Project Directory Validation
    - Check if directory "$PROJECT_NAME" already exists in current
  directory
    - If exists, print error: "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_NAME' already
  exists." and exit with code 1
  3. GitHub Repository Configuration
    - Define constant: GITHUB_RAW_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
  wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main"
    - Define array of files to download:
        - "icm-bubble-template.md"
      - "icm-story-template.md"
      - "icmwriper-5.md"
      - "README.md"
  4. Directory Creation
    - Create directory "$PROJECT_NAME" using mkdir "$PROJECT_NAME"
    - If creation fails, print error: "Error: Failed to create directory
  '$PROJECT_NAME'." and exit with code 1
  5. File Download Loop
    - For each file in the files array:
        - Construct full URL: "$GITHUB_RAW_URL/$filename"
      - Use curl to download: curl -f -sS -o "$PROJECT_NAME/$filename" 
  "$url"
      - If curl fails (non-zero exit code):
            - Print error: "Error: Failed to download $filename from
  GitHub. Please check your internet connection and repository
  availability."
        - Remove the partially created directory: rm -rf "$PROJECT_NAME"
        - Exit with code 1
  6. File Renaming
    - Rename "$PROJECT_NAME/README.md" to
  "$PROJECT_NAME/icmwriper-5-README.md"
    - Use command: mv "$PROJECT_NAME/README.md" 
  "$PROJECT_NAME/icmwriper-5-README.md"
  7. Success Message
    - Print: "Success: Project '$PROJECT_NAME' created with ICMwRIPER-5
  template files."
    - Exit with code 0

  Installation Steps

  1. Create the script file at /tmp/icmwriper-5 (temporary location for
  creation)
  2. Set executable permissions: chmod +x /tmp/icmwriper-5
  3. Test the script in /tmp location
  4. Move to final location: sudo mv /tmp/icmwriper-5 
  /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5
  5. Verify installation: which icmwriper-5

  4. Add subcommand validation (check first argument is "generate")
  5. Add error message for unknown subcommands
  6. Store second argument as PROJECT_NAME variable
  7. Add directory existence check for PROJECT_NAME
  8. Add error message for existing directory
  9. Define GITHUB_RAW_URL constant as
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main"
  10. Define FILES array with 4 filenames: icm-bubble-template.md,
  icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md, README.md

  14. In loop: construct download URL for each file
  15. In loop: use curl with flags -f -sS -o to download each file
  16. In loop: add error handling for curl failure with cleanup (remove
  directory) and exit
  17. Rename README.md to icmwriper-5-README.md using mv command
  18. Add success message with project name
  19. Set executable permissions on script with chmod +x /tmp/icmwriper-5
  20. Move script to /usr/local/bin/ using sudo: sudo mv /tmp/icmwriper-5
   /usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5
  21. Verify installation with which icmwriper-5

        97 +  ### Implementation Summary
        98 +  
        99 +  **Completed**: 2025-10-01 23:50
       100 +  
       101 +  All 21 checklist items have been successfully completed.
           +  The `icmwriper-5` command is now installed and 
           + operational.
       102 +  
       103 +  ### Changes Made
       104 +  
       105 +  1. **Created bash script** at 
           + `/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5` with the following features:
       106 +     - Argument validation for exactly 2 parameters
       107 +     - Subcommand validation (only "generate" is 
           + supported)
       108 +     - Project directory existence check
       109 +     - GitHub raw file downloading via curl
       110 +     - Error handling with cleanup on failure
       111 +     - Automatic README.md renaming to 
           + icmwriper-5-README.md
       112 +  
       113 +  2. **Script structure**:
       114 +     - Uses bash arrays for file list management
       115 +     - Implements proper error codes (exit 1 for errors, 
           + exit 0 for success)
       116 +     - Provides clear error messages for all failure 
           + scenarios
       117 +     - Cleans up partial directory on download failure
       118 +  
       119 +  3. **Installation**:
       120 +     - Script placed in `/usr/local/bin/` for global 
           + access
       121 +     - Executable permissions set (755)
       122 +     - Verified with `which icmwriper-5` (returns 
           + `/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5`)
       123 +  
       124 +  ### Files Modified/Created
       125 +  
       126 +  - **Created**: `/usr/local/bin/icmwriper-5` (49 lines, 
           + bash script)
       127 +  
       128 +  ### Notes
       129 +  
       130 +  - User manually executed the sudo command for moving 
           + script to /usr/local/bin/ due to password requirement
       131 +  - Script downloads from GitHub main branch at: https://r
           + aw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main
       132 +  - Downloads 4 files: icm-bubble-template.md, 
           + icm-story-template.md, icmwriper-5.md, README.md
       133 +  - README.md is automatically renamed to 
           + icmwriper-5-README.md after download

  Let me first read the current README.md and locate the icmwriper-5
  command file:

● Bash(ls -la /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/)

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good, I can see the icmwriper-5 executable file is in the project root
  directory. Now let me check the README to understand where to add the
  installation guide:

● Read(README.md)
  ⎿  Read 146 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I understand the structure. I need to add an installation guide for the
   icmwriper-5 command that's now in the project root. The guide should
  explain how to install it on Windows 11 WSL2 Ubuntu after cloning from
  GitHub.

  Questions:
  1. Should I add this installation guide as a new section in the README
  (e.g., "Installing the icmwriper-5 Command" or "Installation"), and
  where should it be positioned - before or after "Getting Started"?
  2. Should the guide replace the existing "Getting Started" section 1
  about template files, or should it be an additional prerequisite step?

  Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode once you clarify, or I can proceed
  with a reasonable placement (e.g., add a new "Installation" section
  before "Getting Started").

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Understood. I will replace the existing "Getting Started" section 1
  (lines 58-63 about template files) with installation instructions for
  the icmwriper-5 command.

  Research complete. Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode.

  Awaiting your signal: "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll brainstorm different approaches for presenting the
  installation guide:

  Approach 1: Manual Installation Steps

  - Content: Step-by-step instructions to manually copy and install the
  command
  - Steps: Clone repo → Navigate to directory → Copy script to
  /usr/local/bin/ → Set permissions
  - Pros: Simple, direct, users understand exactly what's happening
  - Cons: Requires multiple manual commands

  Approach 2: Installation Script Approach

  - Content: Provide a one-liner or simple script that automates
  installation
  - Steps: Clone repo → Run installation script
  - Pros: Faster, less error-prone
  - Cons: Requires creating an additional install.sh script (which
  doesn't currently exist)

  Approach 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

  - Content: Show both the quick manual steps AND explain what the
  command does
  - Structure:
    a. Prerequisites (Git, curl installed)
    b. Clone the repository
    c. Install the command (copy to /usr/local/bin/)
    d. Verify installation
    e. Usage example
  - Pros: Clear, comprehensive, educational, no additional files needed
  - Cons: Slightly longer section

  Recommendation

  I suggest Approach 3 (Hybrid) because:
  1. It teaches users what's happening (aligns with ICMwRIPER-5's
  educational philosophy)
  2. No additional files needed - works with current repository state
  3. Includes verification step to confirm success
  4. Provides immediate usage example to get users started
  5. Clear prerequisite requirements for WSL2 Ubuntu environment

  The new section would replace the current "1. Set Up Template Files"
  and include:
  - Prerequisites check
  - Git clone command
  - Installation command (sudo cp)
  - Verification command (which icmwriper-5)
  - Quick usage example (icmwriper-5 generate my-project)

  Ready to proceed to PLAN mode if you approve this approach, or would 
  you prefer a different approach?
