● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the current implementation of the
  icmwriper-5 command before proceeding. Let me examine the
  codebase structure and locate the command implementation.

● RESEARCH OBSERVATIONS:

  The current icmwriper-5 command is a bash script located at
  /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5 with the
  following characteristics:

  1. Current functionality: Only supports icmwriper-5 generate 
  <project-name> subcommand
  2. Current structure:
    - Validates exactly 2 arguments
    - Only accepts "generate" as the first subcommand
    - Downloads template files from GitHub
    - Creates a new project directory

  REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS:

  According to icm-story-2025-10-02--09-50.md, the new
  requirement is:
  - Add a story subcommand: icmwriper-5 story <story-name>
  - Copy file <story-name> from current directory
  - Name the copy as icm-story-<timestamp> where timestamp is
  current system time

  QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION:

  1. What timestamp format should be used? (e.g.,
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm based on existing file naming patterns in
  the repository?)
  2. Should the command validate that <story-name> file exists
  before copying?
  3. Should there be error handling if the copy operation
  fails?
  4. Should the new icm-story-<timestamp> file be created in
  the current directory or in a specific location?

> 1. What timestamp format should be used? (e.g.,
  yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm based on existing file naming patterns in
  the repository?)
A: Based on existing file naming patterns in the repository, 
such as `2025-10-02--20-19`.

  2. Should the command validate that <story-name> file exists
  before copying?
A: Yes. And report the issue and quit if find any errors.

  3. Should there be error handling if the copy operation
  fails?
A: Yes. And report the issue and quit if find any errors.

  4. Should the new icm-story-<timestamp> file be created in
  the current directory or in a specific location?
A: Created in the current directory, please.

● [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. I now have a complete
  understanding of the requirements:

  COMPLETE REQUIREMENTS UNDERSTANDING:

  1. New subcommand: icmwriper-5 story <story-name>
  2. Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm (e.g.,
  2025-10-02--20-19)
  3. Validation: Check if <story-name> file exists; exit with
  error if not
  4. Error handling: Report issues and quit if copy operation
  fails
  5. Output location: Current directory
  6. Output filename: icm-story-<timestamp>.md (where timestamp
   = current system time)

  CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE:

  The existing script:
  - Uses argument count validation ($# -ne 2)
  - Uses hardcoded subcommand check ("$1" != "generate")
  - Has error handling with exit codes
  - Prints success/error messages

  REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS:

  The script needs to:
  - Accept both "generate" and "story" subcommands
  - Implement different logic paths based on subcommand
  - For "story" subcommand: validate file existence, generate
  timestamp, copy file with new name

  I have completed my research. Ready to proceed to next mode
  when you signal.

● [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Now I'll explore different approaches for implementing the
  story subcommand:

  APPROACH 1: Extend with if-elif structure
  - Keep the 2-argument validation
  - Replace single subcommand check with if-elif logic
  - Add separate handler for "story" subcommand
  - Advantages: Simple, minimal changes, clear separation of
  logic
  - Disadvantages: Grows linearly with more subcommands

  APPROACH 2: Case statement pattern
  - Replace if-elif with bash case statement
  - More idiomatic for multiple subcommands
  - Advantages: Scalable, cleaner for 3+ subcommands, easier to
   extend
  - Disadvantages: Slightly more complex for just 2 subcommands

  APPROACH 3: Separate function per subcommand
  - Define functions like handle_generate() and handle_story()
  - Use case/if to route to appropriate function
  - Advantages: Very clean, testable, maintainable for complex
  logic
  - Disadvantages: Overkill for current simple implementations

  TIMESTAMP GENERATION OPTIONS:

  Option A: Using date command
  - date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - Advantages: Standard, reliable, portable
  - Disadvantages: None

  Option B: Custom timestamp logic
  - Parse components individually
  - Advantages: More control
  - Disadvantages: Unnecessary complexity

  RECOMMENDATION:
  Approach 1 (if-elif structure) with Option A (date command)
  seems most appropriate because:
  - Minimal changes to existing code
  - Sufficient for 2 subcommands
  - Standard timestamp generation
  - Easy to understand and maintain

  Would you like me to proceed with this approach or would you
  prefer a different option?

● [MODE: PLAN]

  DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

  File to Modify

  - File path: /home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5

  Modifications Required

  1. Update Usage Message (Line 5)

  Current:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 generate <project-name>"

  New:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | story 
  <story-name>}"

  2. Replace Subcommand Validation (Lines 9-13)

  Current:
  # Subcommand validation
  if [ "$1" != "generate" ]; then
      echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Only 'generate' is 
  supported."
      exit 1
  fi

  New:
  # Subcommand routing
  if [ "$1" = "generate" ]; then
      # Generate subcommand handler will go here
  elif [ "$1" = "story" ]; then
      # Story subcommand handler will go here
  else
      echo "Error: Unknown command '$1'. Supported commands: 
  'generate', 'story'."
      exit 1
  fi

  3. Wrap Existing Generate Logic (Lines 15-48)

  Action: Indent and place existing generate logic (lines
  15-48) inside the first if block

  Structure:
  if [ "$1" = "generate" ]; then
      # Store project name
      PROJECT_NAME="$2"

      # [All existing generate logic from lines 15-48]

  elif [ "$1" = "story" ]; then

  4. Implement Story Subcommand Logic

  Action: Add new story handler in the elif block

  Logic to implement:
  elif [ "$1" = "story" ]; then
      # Store story name
      STORY_NAME="$2"

      # Check if source file exists
      if [ ! -f "$STORY_NAME" ]; then
          echo "Error: File '$STORY_NAME' does not exist."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Generate timestamp
      TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")

      # Define target filename
      TARGET_FILE="icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md"

      # Copy file
      if ! cp "$STORY_NAME" "$TARGET_FILE"; then
          echo "Error: Failed to copy '$STORY_NAME' to 
  '$TARGET_FILE'."
          exit 1
      fi

      # Success message
      echo "Success: Copied '$STORY_NAME' to '$TARGET_FILE'."
      exit 0

  Final File Structure

  Lines 1-3:   Shebang and blank line
  Lines 4-7:   Argument count validation (updated usage
  message)
  Lines 9-11:  Subcommand routing start
  Lines 12-XX: Generate subcommand handler (existing logic)
  Lines XX-YY: Story subcommand handler (new logic)
  Lines YY-ZZ: Unknown command error handler

  Key Implementation Details

  - Timestamp format: yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm using date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - File existence check: [ ! -f "$STORY_NAME" ]
  - Copy operation: cp "$STORY_NAME" "$TARGET_FILE" with error
  checking
  - Output file: Always appends .md extension:
  icm-story-$TIMESTAMP.md
  - Error handling: All errors print message and exit with code
   1
  - Success handling: Print confirmation and exit with code 0

  ---
  IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

  1. Update usage message on line 5 to include both subcommands
  2. Replace subcommand validation (lines 9-13) with
  if-elif-else structure
  3. Move existing generate logic (lines 15-48) into the first
  if block for "generate" subcommand
  4. Add story subcommand handler in elif block with: story
  name variable assignment
  5. Add story subcommand handler: file existence validation
  with error handling
  6. Add story subcommand handler: timestamp generation using
  date command
  7. Add story subcommand handler: target filename definition
  8. Add story subcommand handler: copy operation with error
  handling
  9. Add story subcommand handler: success message output
  10. Update error message in else block to list both supported
   commands
