✻ Thinking…

  The user has referenced the ICMwRIPER-5 protocol by mentioning 
  @icmwriper-5.md and @icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md. According to the 
  protocol I read from the file, I MUST:

  1. Begin EVERY response with mode declaration in brackets
  2. Follow the strict operational protocol
  3. Start in RESEARCH mode unless explicitly told to enter another mode

  The user wants me to convert a Ubuntu script to work on macOS. The 
  business requirements are in the story file that was read automatically. 
  Let me analyze what I have:

  From icm-story-2025-10-05--22-48.md:
  - The project has implemented 4 subcommands (generate, story, bubble, 
  snd) for the @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu command in Windows 11 WSL2 Ubuntu 
  24.04
  - They want me to read @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md and the 
  @icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu script
  - Copy the script and rename it to icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - Convert it to work on macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 in iTerm2 with zsh
  - Maintain all functionality of the 4 subcommands

  Since no explicit mode transition was given, I should start in RESEARCH 
  mode and focus ONLY on understanding what exists, not suggesting 
  implementations.

  I need to:
  1. Read the context file mentioned
  2. Read the Ubuntu script
  3. Understand the current implementation
  4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

  Let me start with RESEARCH mode.

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to understand the existing Ubuntu script and context before
  proceeding. Let me read the referenced files to understand the
  current implementation.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The context file doesn't exist (there might be a typo in the filename), 
  but I found the Ubuntu script. Let me read it to understand the current 
  implementation.

⏺ Read(icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu)
  ⎿  Read 167 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I now understand the Ubuntu script. Let me also check if there might be a
   context file with a different filename pattern to get more information.

⏺ Search(pattern: "*icm-context*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Found the context files! The one referenced in the story has a typo (2925
   instead of 2025). Let me read the correct context file.

⏺ Read(icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md)
  ⎿  Read 333 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a complete understanding of the current Ubuntu script and its 
  functionality. Let me also examine the template files to understand the 
  full context:

⏺ Search(pattern: "*template*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I've now gathered all the information I need to understand the current 
  Ubuntu script implementation. Let me summarize what I learned:

  Ubuntu Script Analysis (icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu):

  1. Language: Bash shell script with shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
  2. Commands: 4 subcommands - generate, story, bubble, snb
  3. Functionality:
    - generate: Creates new project directory and downloads template files 
  from GitHub
    - story: Copies story file with current timestamp
    - bubble: Copies bubble file with timestamp from latest story file  
    - snb: Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical timestamp

  Key Ubuntu-specific dependencies identified:

  - curl for downloading files
  - sed for text replacement (with -i flag for in-place editing)
  - date for timestamp generation 
  - Basic file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls)

  Potential macOS compatibility issues to consider:

  1. sed -i behavior differs between GNU sed (Linux) and BSD sed (macOS)
  2. date command formatting may differ
  3. File system case sensitivity differences
  4. ls sorting behavior
  5. curl availability and options

  Since I'm in RESEARCH mode, I should focus ONLY on understanding and ask 
  clarifying questions if needed.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the Ubuntu script and context files, I now
  understand the current implementation:

  Current Ubuntu Script Analysis

  Script: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu (167 lines)
  Platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04Functionality: 4 subcommands implemented

  Subcommands:

  1. generate - Creates project directory, downloads 4 template files
  from GitHub
  2. story - Copies story file with current timestamp
  (icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md)
  3. bubble - Copies bubble file using timestamp from latest story
  file, updates story references
  4. snb - Creates matched story-bubble pair with identical timestamp

  Key Dependencies Identified:

  - curl for GitHub file downloads
  - sed -i for in-place text replacement
  - date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M" for timestamp generation
  - Standard file operations (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls -t)

  Critical Functions:

  - File existence validation
  - Timestamp extraction from filenames
  - Pattern matching for story reference updates
  - Error handling with cleanup

  Questions for Clarification:

  1. Context file reference: The story mentions
  @icm-context-2925-10-03--22-01.md but the actual file is
  icm-context-2025-10-03--22-01.md (typo in year). Should I proceed
  with the 2025 version?
  2. macOS environment details: You mentioned macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with
   iTerm2 and zsh. Should I assume standard macOS command-line tools or
   do you have any custom installations (like GNU coreutils via
  Homebrew)?
  3. Sudo requirements: The script downloads files and creates
  directories. Are there any specific permissions or locations where
  sudo might be needed that I should be aware of?
  4. GitHub access: The script downloads from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main/. Should I
   assume internet connectivity and GitHub access will work the same
  way on macOS?

  I understand the complete functionality and am ready to proceed once
  you provide any clarifications needed.

  3. Sudo requirements: The script downloads files and creates
  directories. Are there any specific permissions or locations
  where sudo might be needed that I should be aware of?
  A: 我也不知道。请你在执行过程中一旦遇到需要sudo权限的时候就告知我具体
的命令并等待我手工执行完成后再继续。
  
  4. GitHub access: The script downloads from
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5/main/.
  Should I assume internet connectivity and GitHub access will work
   the same way on macOS?
A: 你只须修改当前目录下的脚本`icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`。macOS能够访问互
联网和github。脚本的位置实际上在https://github.com/wubin28/ICMwRIPER-5
。

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  Thank you for the clarifications. I now have all the information
  needed:

  1. Using the 2025 context file ✓
  2. Standard macOS command-line tools ✓
  3. Will prompt for sudo commands when needed ✓
  4. Internet/GitHub access works on macOS ✓
  5. I only need to modify the local script (not the GitHub repository)
   ✓

  I notice the story file mentions snd as one of the 4 subcommands, but
   analyzing the actual script, it's snb (Story aNd Bubble). I'll
  proceed with the actual implementation which is snb.

  Key Differences Between Ubuntu and macOS

  From my analysis, the main compatibility issues that need addressing
  for macOS are:

  1. sed -i behavior: Ubuntu uses sed -i while macOS requires sed -i ''
   for in-place editing
  2. date command: Both should work the same with date 
  +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  3. File operations: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls should work identically
  4. curl: Should work the same on both platforms
  5. Bash arrays and parameter expansion: Should work identically in
  both environments

  The primary change needed is the sed -i syntax modification for macOS
   compatibility.

  Ready to proceed to INNOVATE mode when you give the signal.

⏺ [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Potential Approaches for macOS Script Conversion

  Approach 1: Minimal Modification Strategy

  - Copy the Ubuntu script exactly and only change the
  macOS-incompatible parts
  - Primary change: sed -i to sed -i '' for in-place editing
  - Rename script from icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu to icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - Keep all logic, error handling, and structure identical

  Advantages:
  - Minimal risk of introducing bugs
  - Maintains proven functionality
  - Easy to verify correctness by comparison
  - Quick implementation

  Disadvantages:
  - Doesn't optimize for macOS-specific features
  - Script name in usage message would need updating

  Approach 2: macOS-Optimized Implementation

  - Leverage macOS-specific command features where beneficial
  - Consider using BSD-style command options that might be more native
  - Potentially improve error messages for macOS context
  - Update internal references and documentation

  Advantages:
  - More native macOS experience
  - Could potentially improve performance or compatibility

  Disadvantages:
  - Higher risk of introducing differences in behavior
  - More complex testing required
  - May diverge from proven Ubuntu implementation

  Approach 3: Universal Script with Platform Detection

  - Create a single script that detects the platform and adjusts
  behavior
  - Use uname or similar to detect macOS vs Linux
  - Conditional logic for platform-specific commands

  Advantages:
  - Single script maintains both platforms
  - Reduces maintenance overhead

  Disadvantages:
  - More complex logic
  - Goes beyond the simple "copy and convert" requirement
  - May introduce unexpected behavior

  Approach 4: Hybrid Approach

  - Start with Approach 1 (minimal modification)
  - Add macOS-specific improvements only where they provide clear
  benefits
  - Focus on user experience improvements (like updated usage messages)

  Advantages:
  - Balances safety with optimization
  - Allows for targeted improvements

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires more decision-making about what to change

  Recommendation

  I recommend Approach 1: Minimal Modification Strategy because:

  1. Safety first: The Ubuntu script is proven and functional
  2. Clear requirements: The task asks to "convert" the existing script
   while maintaining "all functionality"
  3. Predictable outcome: Minimal changes mean minimal risk
  4. Easy verification: Simple to compare and validate

  The main changes would be:
  - Script filename: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu → icmwriper-5-for-macos
  - sed syntax: sed -i → sed -i '' (two locations in the script)
  - Usage message: Update script name reference

  This approach ensures the script works identically on macOS while
  making only the necessary platform-specific adjustments.

⏺ [MODE: PLAN]

  Technical Specification for macOS Script Conversion

  Objective

  Convert the existing Ubuntu script icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu to a
  macOS-compatible version named icmwriper-5-for-macos using minimal
  modifications while preserving all functionality.

  Analysis of Required Changes

  Primary Compatibility Issue:
  - Ubuntu: sed -i "pattern" file (in-place editing)
  - macOS: sed -i '' "pattern" file (requires empty string after -i
  flag)

  Affected Lines:
  - Line 111: sed -i "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--
  [0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g"
  "$TARGET_FILE"
  - Line 157: sed -i "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--
  [0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g"
  "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

  Secondary Changes:
  - Line 5: Update usage message script name reference
  - Script filename: icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu → icmwriper-5-for-macos

  Detailed Implementation Plan

  File Operations

  2. Target file:
  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos
  3. Operation: Copy then modify in-place

  Specific Code Changes

  Change 1: Usage Message (Line 5)
  # FROM:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5 {generate <project-name> | story 
  <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb <story-name>}"

  # TO:
  echo "Usage: icmwriper-5-for-macos {generate <project-name> | story 
  <story-name> | bubble <bubble-name> | snb <story-name>}"

  Change 2: First sed Command (Line 111)
  # FROM:

  }-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g"
  "$BUBBLE_TARGET"

  Verification Strategy

  - All other commands (curl, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls, date) work
  identically on macOS
  - File permissions and executable bit will be preserved during copy
  - Script structure and logic remain completely unchanged
  - Error handling patterns remain identical

  No Changes Required For:

  - Shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env bash (works on both platforms)
  - File operations: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, ls -t
  - Date command: date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M"
  - Curl command and options
  - Bash arrays and parameter expansion
  - All validation and error handling logic
  - Exit codes and success messages

⏺ Let's verify the story file was created:

⏺ Bash(ls -la test-macos-project/icm-story-*.md)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):1: no matches found: test-macos-project/icm-story-*.md

⏺ Let me check what files exist in the test project:

⏺ Bash(ls -la test-macos-project/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: test-macos-project/: No such file or directory

⏺ It seems the test project directory is in the wrong location. Let me
  find it:

⏺ Bash(find /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/ -name
      "test-macos-project" -type d)
  ⎿  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project

⏺ Let me check the files in the correct location:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project/)
  ⎿  total 72

  Test 3: Bubble subcommand

⏺ Bash(/Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos
      bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-10-05
    --23-28.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025-10-05--
    23-28.md'.



⏺ Excellent! The bubble command worked correctly and used the timestamp
   from the existing story file. Let me verify the bubble file was
  created:

⏺ Bash(ls -la icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff  870 Oct  5 23:28 icm-bubble-2025-10-05
    --23-28.md


⏺ Let's verify the story reference was updated correctly in the bubble
  file:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md。

⏺ I notice the story reference wasn't updated properly. Let me check
  what happened. The script reported success, but the file still shows
  the template placeholder. Let me check if there's an issue with the
  sed command by testing it manually:

⏺ Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Let me check in the correct directory:

⏺ Bash(find /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/ -name
      "icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md")
  ⎿ /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/test-macos-project/icm-bu
    bble-2025-10-05--23-28.md


⏺ I think there's confusion about the working directory. Let me check
  the bubble file that was actually created:

⏺ Read(icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5 && pwd && ls -la
      icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-28.md 2>/dev/null || echo "File not found
      in main directory")
  ⎿  /Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5
     File not found in main directory

⏺ Let me check what files exist in the main directory and test again
  with proper working directory:

⏺ Bash(rm -rf test-macos-project)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me test the bubble command properly in the main directory where
  the template files exist:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos story icm-story-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to 'icm-story-2025-10-05--
    23-32.md'.


⏺ Now test the bubble command:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-10-05
    --23-32.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025-10-05--
    23-32.md'.



⏺ Great! Now let's verify the story reference was actually updated:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-32.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md。

⏺ The sed command isn't working properly. Let me debug this by testing
  the sed command manually with the actual pattern:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed
      's/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2
      \}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@test-replacement/…)
  ⎿  @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md

⏺ The sed pattern is not matching. Let me check if the issue is with
  the extended regex. On macOS, sed uses basic regex by default. Let me
   test with a simpler pattern first:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed
      's/@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\.md/@test-replacement/g')
  ⎿  @test-replacement

⏺ The issue is that macOS sed doesn't support the extended regex \{n\}
  quantifiers in basic mode. I need to use extended regex mode with -E
  flag or use a different approach. Let me check what the Ubuntu
  version does and fix this:

⏺ Bash(echo "@icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md" | sed -E
      's/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-
      dd--hh-mm)\.md/@test-replacement/g')
  ⎿  @test-replacement

⏺ Perfect! The issue is that I need to use -E for extended regex and
  change the quantifier syntax from \{n\} to {n}. Let me fix the macOS
  script:

⏺ Update(icmwriper-5-for-macos)
  ⎿  Updated icmwriper-5-for-macos with 1 addition and 1 removal    
       108    
       109        # Replace the story reference with the latest 
             story filename
       110        # Match both numeric timestamps and the template 
             placeholder format
       111 -      sed -i '' "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\
           -  }-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           -  \)\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
       111 +      sed -i '' -E "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2
           +  }-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           +  )\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g" "$TARGET_FILE"
       112    
       113        # Success message
       114        echo "Success: Copied '$BUBBLE_NAME' to 
             '$TARGET_FILE' and updated story reference to 
             '$LATEST_STORY'."

⏺ Now fix the second sed command as well:

⏺ Update(icmwriper-5-for-macos)
  ⎿  Updated icmwriper-5-for-macos with 1 addition and 1 removal    
       154    
       155        # Replace the story reference with the newly 
             created story filename
       156        # Match both numeric timestamps and the template 
             placeholder format
       157 -      sed -i '' "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\
           -  }-[0-9]\{2\}--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           -  \)\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"
       157 +      sed -i '' -E "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2
           +  }-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm
           +  )\.md/@$STORY_TARGET/g" "$BUBBLE_TARGET"
       158    
       159        # Success message
       160        echo "Success: Copied '$STORY_NAME' to 
             '$STORY_TARGET'."

⏺ Now let's test the bubble command again to see if the sed fix works:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos bubble icm-bubble-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-10-05
    --23-32.md' and updated story reference to 'icm-story-2025-10-05--
    23-32.md'.



⏺ Excellent! Now let's verify the story reference was updated
  correctly:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-32.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-32.md。

⏺ Perfect! The story reference was updated correctly from
  @icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md to @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-32.md.

  Test 4: SNB subcommand

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos snb icm-story-template.md)
  ⎿ Success: Copied 'icm-story-template.md' to 'icm-story-2025-10-05--
    23-33.md'.
    Success: Copied 'icm-bubble-template.md' to 'icm-bubble-2025-10-05
    … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Let's verify both files were created with matching timestamps and the
   bubble file has the correct story reference:

⏺ Bash(ls -la icm-*-2025-10-05--23-33.md)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff   870 Oct  5 23:33 icm-bubble-2025-10-0
    5--23-33.md
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 binwu  staff  1446 Oct  5 23:33 icm-story-2025-10-05
    --23-33.md



⏺ Bash(grep -n "@icm-story" icm-bubble-2025-10-05--23-33.md)
  ⎿  13:业务需求详见 @icm-story-2025-10-05--23-33.md。

⏺ Perfect! The SNB command worked correctly - both files have matching
  timestamps (23-33) and the bubble file references the correct story
  file.

  Let me also test the generate command one more time to ensure it
  still works:

⏺ Bash(./icmwriper-5-for-macos generate test-final)
  ⎿ Success: Project 'test-final' created with ICMwRIPER-5 template fi
    les.


⏺ Bash(ls -la test-final/)

     drwxr-xr-x@ 49 binwu  staff   1568 Oct  5 23:34 ..
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! All tests passed successfully. Let me clean up the test
  files and complete the testing task:

⏺ Bash(rm -rf test-final icm-*-2025-10-05--23-*.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me update the todo file with the review section:

⏺ Update(todo-2025-10-05--23-21.md)
  ⎿  Updated todo-2025-10-05--23-21.md with 53 additions and 1 removal

        56 +  ### Implementation Summary
        57 +  
        58 +  Successfully converted `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` to 
           + `icmwriper-5-for-macos` with full functionality 
           + preserved.
        59 +  
        60 +  ### Changes Made:
        61 +  
        62 +  1. ✅ **Script copy completed**: Created `/Users/binwu
           + /OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-macos`
        63 +  
        64 +  2. ✅ **Usage message updated**: Changed script name 
           + reference from `icmwriper-5` to `icmwriper-5-for-macos`
           +  in line 5
        65 +  
        66 +  3. ✅ **sed commands converted for macOS 
           + compatibility**:
        67 +     - Added `-E` flag for extended regex support
        68 +     - Changed quantifier syntax from `\{n\}` to `{n}`
        69 +     - Maintained `-i ''` for in-place editing without 
           + backup
        70 +     - Both sed commands (lines 111 and 157) 
           + successfully updated
        71 +  
        72 +  4. ✅ **File permissions verified**: Script maintains 
           + executable permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`)
        73 +  
        74 +  5. ✅ **All subcommands tested successfully**:
        75 +     - `generate`: Creates project directory and 
           + downloads 4 template files from GitHub
        76 +     - `story`: Creates timestamped story files 
           + (`icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`)
        77 +     - `bubble`: Creates timestamped bubble files using 
           + latest story timestamp, updates story references
        78 +     - `snb`: Creates matched story-bubble pairs with 
           + identical timestamps
        79 +  
        80 +  ### Key Technical Fix:
        81 +  
        82 +  **Issue discovered**: macOS sed doesn't support basic 
           + regex quantifiers `\{n\}` by default
        83 +  **Solution applied**: Used extended regex mode with 
           + `-E` flag and updated quantifier syntax
        84 +  
        85 +  **Before (Ubuntu)**:
        86 +  ```bash
        87 +  sed -i "s/@icm-story-\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\
           + }--[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm\)\.md/@$LAT
           + EST_STORY/g"
        88 +  ```
        89 +  
        90 +  **After (macOS)**:
        91 +  ```bash
        92 +  sed -i '' -E 
           + "s/@icm-story-([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}--[0-9]{2}-[0-
           + 9]{2}|yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm)\.md/@$LATEST_STORY/g"
        93 +  ```
        94 +  
        95 +  ### Testing Results:
        96 +  
        97 +  All four subcommands tested and verified working 
           + correctly:
        98 +  - ✅ Usage message displays correctly
        99 +  - ✅ Generate command downloads all template files
       100 +  - ✅ Story command creates timestamped files
       101 +  - ✅ Bubble command uses story timestamps and updates 
           + references correctly
       102 +  - ✅ SNB command creates matched pairs with identical 
           + timestamps
       103 +  - ✅ Story reference replacement confirmed working in 
           + bubble files
       104 +  
       105 +  ### Conversion Status: ✅ COMPLETE
       106 +  
       107 +  The macOS script `icmwriper-5-for-macos` successfully 
           + implements all functionality from the Ubuntu version 
           + and is ready for use on macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with 
           + iTerm2 and zsh.
       108   \ No newline at end of file

⏺ Execution Summary

  Successfully converted the Ubuntu script to macOS with full
  functionality preserved. The key changes made were:

  1. Script name updates - Updated usage message to reference
  icmwriper-5-for-macos
  2. macOS sed compatibility - Added -E flag and updated regex syntax
  for macOS compatibility
  3. Preserved all functionality - All 4 subcommands (generate, story,
  bubble, snb) tested and verified working

  The most critical fix was updating the sed commands to use extended
  regex mode (-E) and changing the quantifier syntax from \{n\} to {n}
  to work with macOS sed.

  The macOS script is now fully functional and ready for use on macOS
  Sequoia 15.6.1 with iTerm2 and zsh.

       81    **Language**: Bash shell script (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`)
       82    
       83 -  **Platform**: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04
       83 +  **Platforms**:
       84 +  - **Ubuntu**: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows 11
       85 +  - **macOS**: macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with iTerm2 and zsh
       86    
       87    **External dependencies**: `curl` (for file downloads),
             `sed` (for text replacement), `date` (for timestamps)
       88    
       89 +  **Platform-specific considerations**:
       90 +  - **Ubuntu**: Uses `sed -i` for in-place editing
       91 +  - **macOS**: Uses `sed -i '' -E` for in-place editing 
          + with extended regex support
       92 +

⏺ Update(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Updated icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md with 5 additions and 1 
     removal
       106    
       107    ### Script Architecture
       108    
       109 -  **Command pattern**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu 
           - <subcommand> <argument>`
       109 +  **Command patterns**:
       110 +  - Ubuntu: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu <subcommand> 
           + <argument>`
       111 +  - macOS: `icmwriper-5-for-macos <subcommand> 
           + <argument>`
       112    
       113    **Routing structure**: `if-elif-else` subcommand 
             dispatcher
       114    
     ...
       116    
       117    **Success handling**: All operations output 
             confirmation messages with exit code 0
       118    
       119 +  **Cross-platform compatibility**: Both scripts 
           + implement identical functionality with 
           + platform-specific optimizations
       120 +  
       121    ### Key Design Decisions
       122    
       123    #### Decision 1: Bubble timestamp matches story 
             timestamp

⏺ Now I need to add a new section about the macOS conversion work and
  update the usage examples and context metadata:

⏺ Update(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Updated icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md with 15 additions     
       178    
       179    **Benefit**: Maintains consistency; either both files 
             are created or neither
       180    
       181 +  #### Decision 7: Cross-platform implementation 
           + strategy
       182 +  
       183 +  **Rationale**: Support both Ubuntu and macOS 
           + environments while maintaining code consistency
       184 +  
       185 +  **Implementation**: Separate scripts with minimal 
           + platform-specific modifications
       186 +  
       187 +  **Key differences**:
       188 +  - Ubuntu: `sed -i "pattern" file`
       189 +  - macOS: `sed -i '' -E "pattern" file` (requires empty
           +  string after -i and extended regex)
       190 +  
       191 +  **Benefits**:
       192 +  - Platform-native user experience
       193 +  - Identical functionality across platforms
       194 +  - Easy maintenance and testing
       195 +  
       196    ## Implementation Details
       197    
       198    The `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` script (167 lines) 
             implements four subcommands with consistent error 
             handling and validation patterns.

       198 +  Both platform scripts implement 
           +  four subcommands with consistent error handling and 
           +  validation patterns:
       199    
       200 +  **Ubuntu script**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu` (167 
           + lines)
       201 +  **macOS script**: `icmwriper-5-for-macos` (167 lines

       369    ## Context for AI Tools
       370    
       371 -  This context was created after completing 5 
           - story-bubble iteration pairs. The script is fully 
           - functional and has been tested on WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04. 
           - When continuing development:
       371 +  This context was updated after completing the macOS 
           + conversion project (2025-10-05). Both Ubuntu and macOS 
           + scripts are fully functional and tested. When 
           + continuing development:
       372    
       373 -  - The script file is located at `/home/wzb/OOR/katas/I
           - CMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`
       373 +  **Script locations**:
       374 +  - Ubuntu: `/home/wzb/OOR/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icmwriper-5
           + -for-ubuntu`
       375 +  - macOS: `/Users/binwu/OOR-local/katas/ICMwRIPER-5/icm
           + wriper-5-for-macos`
       376 +  
       377 +  **Development guidelines**:
       378    - Follow the ICMwRIPER-5 methodology documented in 
             `icmwriper-5.md`
       379    - Maintain the existing error handling patterns 
             (validate inputs, provide clear error messages, exit 
             with code 1 on failure)
       380    - Keep timestamp format consistent: 
             `yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm`
       381    - Test all file operations with proper error handling 
             and cleanup
       382 +  - For cross-platform changes, update both scripts 
           + maintaining platform-specific optimizations
       383    - The enhanced sed pattern supports both numeric 
             timestamps and the `yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm` template 
             placeholder
       384    
       385 +  **Platform-specific considerations**:
       386 +  - Ubuntu uses basic sed syntax: `sed -i "pattern" 
           + file`
       387 +  - macOS requires extended regex: `sed -i '' -E 
           + "pattern" file`
       388 +  
       389    The methodology requires AI tools to work in 5 
             distinct modes: RESEARCH, INNOVATE, PLAN, EXECUTE, and 
             REVIEW. Always declare your current mode at the start 
             of each response.
       390    
       391 +  ## Latest Development (2025-10-05)
       392 +  
       393 +  **Requirement**: Convert Ubuntu script to macOS 
           + compatibility while preserving all functionality
       394 +  
       395 +  **Implementation completed**:
       396 +  - Created `icmwriper-5-for-macos` from 
           + `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`
       397 +  - Updated usage message to reference correct script 
           + name
       398 +  - Modified sed commands for macOS compatibility:
       399 +    - Added `-E` flag for extended regex support
       400 +    - Changed quantifier syntax from `\{n\}` to `{n}`
       401 +    - Maintained `-i ''` for in-place editing
       402 +  - All 4 subcommands tested and verified functional on 
           + macOS Sequoia 15.6.1
       403 +  - Story reference replacement confirmed working in 
           + bubble files
       404 +  
       405 +  **Key technical challenge resolved**: macOS sed 
           + doesn't support basic regex quantifiers `\{n\}` by 
           + default, requiring extended regex mode and syntax 
           + updates.

⏺ [MODE: RESEARCH]

  I need to read the updated context file to understand what changes
  should be made to the README.md based on the latest developments
  (particularly the macOS conversion work that was completed).

⏺ Read(icm-context-2025-10-05--23-56.md)
  ⎿  Read 428 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Based on the updated context file, I can see that the main changes
  needed to the README.md are:

  1. Add macOS support alongside the existing Ubuntu instructions
  2. Update the "Getting Started" section to include both platforms
  3. Add platform-specific installation instructions for macOS
  4. Update command examples to show both Ubuntu and macOS versions
  5. Update project structure to reflect the dual-platform
  implementation

  The key new information is that there's now a icmwriper-5-for-macos
  script that provides identical functionality to the Ubuntu version,
  with platform-specific optimizations for macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with
  iTerm2 and zsh.

  Now I understand what updates need to be made to the README.md file.
  The main changes are to add macOS support documentation alongside the
   existing Ubuntu content, reflecting the dual-platform implementation
   that was completed.

⏺ [MODE: INNOVATE]

  Potential Approaches for Updating README.md

  Based on the context file analysis, I can see several approaches for
  updating the README to reflect the dual-platform implementation:

  Approach 1: Platform-Parallel Structure

  - Organize content to show Ubuntu and macOS instructions side-by-side
  - Keep the existing Ubuntu instructions as the primary flow
  - Add macOS equivalents in parallel sections
  - Maintain separate installation sections for each platform

  Advantages:
  - Clear distinction between platforms
  - Easy to follow for users on a specific platform
  - Preserves existing Ubuntu documentation structure

  Disadvantages:
  - Could make the document longer
  - Some repetition of identical concepts

  Approach 2: Platform-Unified Structure

  - Integrate platform differences into unified sections
  - Use conditional language like "On Ubuntu... On macOS..."
  - Single installation section with platform-specific subsections
  - Unified command examples showing both platforms

  Advantages:
  - More concise documentation
  - Emphasizes cross-platform nature
  - Easier to maintain consistency

  Disadvantages:
  - Might be confusing for single-platform users
  - Less clear separation of platform-specific details

  Approach 3: Platform-Choice Structure

  - Add platform selection guidance at the beginning
  - Create clear sections: "Choose Your Platform" followed by
  platform-specific instructions
  - Separate installation flows but unified conceptual content
  - Platform-specific examples in dedicated sections

  Advantages:
  - User chooses their path early
  - Clear guidance without confusion
  - Maintains detailed platform-specific information

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires restructuring existing content
  - May duplicate some conceptual explanations

  Approach 4: Hybrid Structure

  - Keep conceptual sections unified (methodology, workflow, benefits)
  - Split only technical sections (installation, command examples,
  troubleshooting)
  - Use clear headers to indicate platform-specific vs universal
  content
  - Add a "Platform Support" section highlighting dual implementation

  Advantages:
  - Balances clarity with conciseness
  - Preserves methodology focus while adding technical platform details
  - Minimal restructuring of existing content

  Disadvantages:
  - Requires careful organization to avoid confusion

  Recommended Approach

  I recommend Approach 4: Hybrid Structure because:

  1. Preserves methodology focus: The ICMwRIPER-5 methodology itself is
   platform-agnostic
  2. Clear technical guidance: Platform-specific sections where they
  matter most
  3. Minimal disruption: Builds on existing structure rather than
  complete rewrite
  4. Future-friendly: Easy to add more platforms later if needed

  Key Updates Needed

  1. Update title/intro to mention cross-platform support
  2. Add platform support section highlighting Ubuntu and macOS
  3. Split installation section into platform-specific subsections
  4. Update command examples to show both platforms
  5. Add platform-specific prerequisites and considerations
  6. Update project structure to show both script files

  Would you like me to proceed with this hybrid approach?

       7    ## The Problem
       8    
       9    Directly presenting final requirements to AI often leads
            to code generation that deviates from intended outcomes 
           because the AI lacks human intervention during the 
           development process. Without structured guidance, AI 
           assistants may:

⏺ Task 1 completed. Now proceeding with task 2: Adding new "Platform
  Support" section after introduction.

       19    ICMwRIPER-5 provides a structured, iterative approach 
            that keeps both human and AI aligned throughout the 
            development lifecycle. By separating concerns into 
            distinct phases and maintaining clear context 
            management, this method ensures that AI-generated code 
            stays on track and meets actual requirements.
       20    
       21 +  ## Platform Support
       22 +  
       23 +  ICMwRIPER-5 provides native command-line tools for both
          +  Ubuntu and macOS environments:
       24 +  
       25 +  ### Ubuntu (WSL2)
       26 +  - **Environment**: Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04 
          + or later)
       27 +  - **Command**: `icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu`
       28 +  - **Installation**: Global installation to 
          + `/usr/local/bin/`
       29 +  - **Prerequisites**: Git, curl
       30 +  
       31 +  ### macOS
       32 +  - **Environment**: macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 or later
       33 +  - **Command**: `./icmwriper-5-for-macos` (local script)
       34 +  - **Installation**: Local script usage
       35 +  - **Prerequisites**: iTerm2, zsh, Git, curl
       36 +  
       37 +  Both implementations provide identical functionality 
          + with platform-specific optimizations for the best native
          +  experience.
       38 +  
       39    ## How It Works

       316    
       317    1. Use the `snb` command to create matched 
             story-bubble files:
       318 +  
       319 +     **Ubuntu**:
       320       ```bash
       321       icmwriper-5-for-ubuntu snb icm-story-template.md
       322       ```
       323 +

       327 +     ```
       328 +  
       329       Or create them separately using `story` and 
             `bubble` commands.
       330    
       331    2. Edit the generated story file 
             (`icm-story-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`) according to your
